Preface

India is on the cusp of a digital transformation. Every aspect of life is gradually being shaped by
digital innovations and technologies. Commerce is no different. Digital commerce has immense
potential to fuel economic growth in the country by empowering small businesses, creating
jobs for the youth, enhancing choice for every kind of consumer, and including deserving but
underserved segments of the country. And yet digital commerce in India is just 7 percent of the
overall market, constrained by various barriers.

Against this backdrop, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is working to create a
new paradigm for digital commerce that eliminates many of these barriers. It is determined to
democratise online commerce with an open network that, as the name suggests, has room for
every seller, large or small.

ONDC is a Section 8 company, with a dedicated leadership team and an Advisory Council
comprising senior leaders from the public and private spheres. Since its inception in August
2020, ONDC has been working to digitalise and support grassroots-level entrepreneurs and
local retailers to include them in the digital commerce universe on an equal footing with larger,
more market-savvy, and digitally enabled sellers.

The network will showcase an array of products and services for buyers, exponentially
increasing the number of options available to them at multiple price points. In this way,
ONDC aims to create marketplaces that are more inclusive, competitive, and innovative.

This report presents the vision, architecture, and road map of ONDC. It highlights some early
experiments and spotlights the exciting use cases ONDC could unlock. It describes the
benefits and opportunities ONDC could create for different stakeholders—sellers, buyers,
platforms, and service providers—while also laying out important actions these stakeholders
could take to reap the benefits from this pioneering initiative.

The insights in the report stem from in-depth interviews with business leaders, more than
100 industry experts in India and beyond, and stakeholders across sectors and geographies.
This report draws on joint research carried out by ONDC and McKinsey & Company. We hope
that this detailed report impresses upon you the potential of ONDC and moves you to chart
your own path on this new digital network that could reshape the digital economy.

Executive summary

In an increasingly digital world, India’s rapid
transformation stands out. Low data charges
and 600 million smartphone subscriptions
have ushered 840 million Indians into
an online world of new possibilities.1
Nearly every single adult Indian has
an Aadhaar card, a digitally verifiable
identification document that opens doors
for digital transactions. The Unified
Payments Interface (UPI) has changed the
way most Indians pay. India’s digital public
infrastructure (DPI) is unlocking digital
inclusion for the masses with innovations
across banking and financial services,
healthcare, logistics, transport, and
much more.

The same digital inclusion remains to be
seen in digital commerce, which is a mere
7 percent of the total retail market, with
165 million users.2 Multiple challenges keep
sellers and buyers from online commerce—
their lack of digital ease, the trust factor
in traditional shopping channels, the fears
about security while transacting online, the
difficulties for small businesses operating
on digital trade platforms, and so forth. Only
6 percent of all MSMEs, for instance, actively
sell on e-commerce platforms.3 To boost
digital commerce, we must reimagine it, with
an ecosystem that eliminates or resolves
challenges for stakeholders.

The stage is ready for this shift. The DPI,
combined with the willingness and curiosity
of Indians about what the internet can offer,
could boost digital commerce.

This is the vision of ONDC: An open
network for digital commerce that will
establish open, inclusive, and competitive
marketplaces online, creating choice and
opportunity for everyone, by everyone.

India’s ‘tech-ade’:
Unlocking digital-led
growth

India’s internet usage numbers tell the story
of a connected, young country (nearly half
of the population is younger than 25 years
old) hungrily adopting technology for greater
convenience: 50 million merchants and
300 million users transacted $1.5 trillion
worth of digital payments in 2022 alone;
96 percent of highway tolls came in as
FASTag payments; Aadhaar identification
covers 90 percent of India’s population; and
direct benefits transfers have saved Indians
$25 billion in the past eight years.4

Five defining trends will continue
to drive this growth

The emergence of digital public
infratructure (DPI) that unlocks digital
inclusion at population scale: This
comprehensive infrastructure manages
digital identity, payments, and data and is
accessible across sectors (Exhibit E1). It is
prompting innovations, and its continuous
evolution could fuel broad-based, inclusive,
and democratic growth. The widespread use
of the Unified Payments Interface is just one
success story of the DPI.

The rise of private-sector investments
boosting the economy: Entrepreneurship is
booming in India. The world’s third-largest
start-up economy and home to 107 unicorns
across digital products and services,5 India
is a choice destination for private equity and
venture capital funding.

Democratising digital commerce in India

The advent of 5G data speeds: Dropping
data costs and rising data speeds over the
past five years prompted an 18-fold growth
in India’s data consumption.6 The arrival of
5G is likely to boost internet use, attracting
customers with innovations such as video
commerce, live commerce, and chat-led
commerce.

Multilingual, conversational AI
technologies to capture the next wave
of internet users: While the first language
of the internet is English, only a fraction of
Indians understand it. The government is
investing heavily in R&D for technologies
such as AI-based language models.7
Such advances could feed into creating
vernacular, video-based content and
conversational and generative AI capabilities
that bring more users of regional languages
into the online world.

Democratisation of data by giving data
back to the individuals and businesses that
generate it: Data in the physical world has
traditionally been disaggregated and hard
to access. But in a huge shift, individuals
can now access, control, and share their
personal data and verifiable credentials.
Data that had previously been visible to
only a few aggregators or institutions is now
available to the individual who generates
it, and (with their consent) can be shared
with public and private institutions. A few
digital public infrastructure initiatives
enable this democratisation. For example,
the Data Empowerment and Protection
Architecture lets individuals share verifiable
data with banks or other institutions for
their own needs. Account aggregators
allow customers to share personal financial
data across financial institutions, speeding
up loan approvals and enhancing wealth
management.8

Room for growth in digital
commerce

India’s digital commerce journey started over
a decade after the United States and China,
and today digital commerce accounts for

7 percent of India’s retail economy (while it
is 15 percent in the US and 25 percent
in China).9 Headroom exists for massive
growth in India in the years to come. There
is scope for growth among the internet
using population—today, 450 million of the
840 million connected Indians voraciously
consume content online, but only 165 million
transact for digital commerce (Exhibit E2).10
That means around 75 percent of Indians
who have internet access are not shopping
online— with the right, conducive factors,
this could change.

Bringing the next 500 million consumers and
100 million sellers to trade online could grow
digital commerce in India. However, some
barriers to adoption could stand in the way.

Digital commerce is just getting started

Location and preferences dictate online
shopping statistics. Of the 165 million
consumers who already use digital
commerce, a much smaller number (about
10 million to 15 million) are power users.
They typically live in urban areas and shop
across sectors. These power users drive
high penetration figures in sectors such
as electronics (35 percent) and fashion
(11 percent).11 Even here, consumers often
shy away from digital commerce, due to a
lack of comfort or trust with online shopping
English-first platforms. This is especially true
of the grocery sector—only 1 to 2 percent of
the country’s largest consumption category
is online.12

Less than 5 million of 100 million MSMEs
are registered to sell on e-commerce
platforms

The seller space in digital commerce is
consolidated: less than 5 million MSMEs
are registered to sell online, with an even
smaller number getting meaningful business
from the large commerce platforms.13 They
lack either digital access or the money
and confidence to operate via digital trade
platforms.

Indian business-to-business (B2B) sellers
lag behind the global average, too: their
digital commerce penetration is 1 to
1.5 percent, far behind the world average
of 20 percent.14 The largely unorganised
products and services sector often
has sellers that are a party of one, with
limited reach and visibility online. India’s
eight million independent professionals
offering skilled services are largely absent
from digital commerce platforms. Of the
200 million-plus unorganised labour force
across sectors, only eight to ten million
are digitally discoverable through digital
commerce platforms.

Digital commerce unit economics remain a
challenge

Despite the massive scale of a population
like India’s, unit economics remains a
challenge in multiple sectors.

Consumers have shown neither the ability
nor the willingness to absorb supply chain
costs (30 to 100 rupees per order), especially
for smaller orders. The multiplicative scale
of e-commerce can happen only if the digital
commerce supply chain integrates with
India’s incredibly efficient, disaggregated,
and, in some cases, informal supply chains
(distributors, wholesale, shop-led delivery,
and the like).

These barriers to a vibrant digital commerce
ecosystem could fall. Faster internet,
multilingual and AI-powered conversational
interfaces, and private investment in digital
infrastructure are already set to unlock
higher volumes of digital commerce.
An open network could be a further catalyst.
It would allow access to network participants
regardless of the platforms and applications
used by the buyers or sellers, making room
for multiple customer preferences and for
sellers big and small.

ONDC: A pioneering initiative to
boost digital commerce

ONDC presents an alternative to the existing
platform-centric model. Moving the diverse
Indian bazaar of goods and services online
democratises digital commerce for buyers
and sellers. Buyers can tap into it using any
participating app to launch a search for an
item. The network makes it possible for
them to connect with thousands of sellers
across the country who sell on ONDC via
their preferred seller app. Within seconds,
the customer sees a set of choices at a
range of price points, along with transparent
options for delivery modes, times, and costs
provided by a choice of logistics operators.

Democratising digital commerce in India

While the early ONDC pilots have focused on
a few use cases such as hyperlocal grocery
and online food delivery, some interesting
innovations highlight the diversity of what
the network could offer. Namma Yatri allows
commuters in Bengaluru to directly book an
auto-rickshaw and pay its driver the entire
fare. More than 47,000 registered drivers
have completed over six lakh trips. Another
player, Unified Energy Interface, empowers
electronic vehicle owners to locate, access,
and pay for the use of charging networks
hosted by seven providers, both big and
small, across 14,000 charging stations.

In the fullness of time, the open network
could unleash ten kinds of use cases, as
follows:

1.  Boosting the direct-to-consumer (D2C)
ecosystem. With the reduced cost of
customer acquisition and reduced buyer
and seller app fee, sellers could find it
financially attractive to build D2C brands.

2.  Putting self-employed professionals

on the map. Self-employed people could
more easily promote themselves on an
open, inclusive marketplace, attracting
attention and business from consumers.

ONDC could enable economic growth by
helping buyers and sellers overcome the
challenges to digital commerce through the
following three core attributes:

 —  It is interoperable. Network participants
work together without being configured
to any single platform. That means users
can tap into the network through any
buyer or seller app for digital commerce.

 — It is unbundled. ONDC breaks down

complex systems into granular activities
or micro services. For example, in an
e-commerce transaction, the seller-side,
logistics, payments, and buyer-side
activities can be handled by different
entities.

 — It is decentralised. Data availability and
control over a transaction lie at both the
buyer and seller ends.

Across the digital commerce ecosystem,
consumers, providers, and buyer and seller
apps could benefit from access to such a
network.

The ONDC lens: Reimagining
digital commerce

While India has the scope and space for
all kinds of commerce to coexist, ONDC
could expand opportunities across the
landscape. Any seller—big or small, digitally
savvy or not—could participate in an open
network without needing to build the entire
ecosystem on their own. With unbundling
making it possible to offer discrete
micro services, ONDC could also enable
specialisation, allowing each participant
to operate from a position of strength,
innovation, and uniqueness.

3.  Digitalising B2B commerce. Retailers
could access a wider distribution
network to save time and costs, while
direct linkages between retailers and
manufacturers could improve margins
in sectors such as agriculture and
construction.

4.  Amplifying hyperlocal goods and
omnichannel convenience. Digital
channels would take the neighbourhood
market online to serve hyperlocal
demand, while consumers could use
omnichannel availability to order from
home after checking out a product in a
store.

5.  Bringing hyperlocal services within

reach. Consumers across India could find
the full range of services on the network.

6.  Taking financial services further.

ONDC’s transaction-based data could
support innovative new offerings to
provide businesses with greater access
to credit.

7.  Growing peer-to-peer commerce.
The decentralised network would
enable peer-to-peer commerce among
consumers, peer sellers, and self-
employed professionals.

8.  Empowering more people with

education and skills. More learners
and workers could access skills-based
education, vocational training, career
counselling, and career opportunities,
which could engender a more equitable,
skills-driven labour market in India.

9.  Making logistics efficient. Once

digitalised, the entire supply chain
could improve price visibility, and higher
delivery volumes could bring down
logistics costs.

Democratising digital commerce in India 10. Taking India to the world. India’s digital
commerce infrastructure could promote
cross-border trade via marketplaces,
helping MSMEs become discoverable by
global consumers and businesses.

A combinatorial explosion of
possibilities

Over time, ONDC could power India’s digital
economy to emerge as a vibrant digital
commerce universe - making it meaningfully
bigger, broader and more inclusive.15

India could see digital consumption surge
fivefold to reach $340 billion by 2030, with
500 million digitally transacting consumers.

The network could be broader, with digital
penetration across B2B companies growing
to 8 to 10 percent.

It could emerge as a more inclusive network
with the scope to connect around 80 to
90 million self-employed workers with
demand, and bring six to seven times more
MSMEs into a buzzing, diverse ecosystem.

ONDC could emerge as a network of
networks, setting off a combinatorial
explosion (Exhibit E3). The innumerable
permutations and combinations enabled
by such an interconnected network could
unleash possibilities that are hard to imagine.

With ONDC, India could exceed expectations
for the growth and possibilities of digital
commerce. The network effect could give
rise to a nerve centre of new connections
sparking continuous innovation and
advances.

Building trust and scale
A high-trust environment and widespread
adoption could make all the difference
between potential and reality for this
pioneering initiative. This will be the key for
ONDC to work in an impatient digital world.

Fostering an environment of mutual trust:
The willingness of consumers to use ONDC-
linked buyer apps will depend on their
experience with the network.

A core characteristic of the open network
is that it unbundles a series of services
that would otherwise be unified on a single
platform. Multiple participants deliver their

15  Syndicated McKinsey Research.

respective components in the value chain.
While allowing for individual margins and
profitability, each of these participants
needs to deliver to a high standard.

In an unbundled environment where no one
player controls the end-to-end value chain,
multiple challenges affect the customer
journey, from search and discovery and
order placement and fulfilment to payments,
returns, and grievances. ONDC, along with
a posse of technology service providers, is
looking to address these concerns with a
mix of clear network policies, enhanced and
optimised API definitions, and innovations in
third-party tools and solutions.

Building scale: Having sufficient
participants on the network could help to
unlock benefits such as simplified, efficient
logistics and lower customer acquisition
costs. It could also encourage providers to
invest in the capabilities required (such as
inventory digitalisation).

ONDC would play a market-making role,
facilitating multiple other participants to
scale up. It could build a mix of shapers who
invest in developing the ecosystem, which
may include large, influential companies as
well as innovative young organisations that
can push the boundaries of possibility and
create new business models. And finally,
a select few use cases could scale up,
establishing what might be possible with
this network. This could encourage more
participants to join the market, creating a
virtuous cycle of participation.

A seismic shift: Transforming
digital commerce in sectors

This report considers the potential of ONDC
to transform digital commerce through a
sectoral lens. Each sector deep-dive begins
with an overview of the present landscape
of digital commerce for that sector. It goes
on to outline the challenges or barriers
restricting various stakeholders from
participating in digital commerce. It then
envisions the possibilities ONDC could
unlock for the sector. It ends with a set of
considerations—shifts that could shape and
unleash the power of digital commerce in the
sector.

Democratising digital commerce in India

every sector, this report focuses on seven
of the largest sectors in B2C trade (by
total spending): grocery, fashion and
lifestyle, electronics, online food delivery,
pharmaceuticals, mobility, and hospitality.

Digitalisation and the open network could
make an immense difference to B2B
enterprises in India. In particular, it could
benefit small businesses: MSME-to-MSME
commerce is the most underserved type of
transaction for multiple reasons and could
receive a vital boost on the open network.
The report focuses on ONDC’s potential to
transform two core sectors in B2B trade—
construction and agriculture. In construction
and real estate, contractors procure cement,
bricks, tiles, and other building materials
in bulk. Agriculture depends on retailers
purchasing inputs (such as fertilisers and
pesticides) from manufacturers before
selling the products to farmers.

The report then lays out the potential for
cross-cutting sectors—financial services
and logistics—where digital commerce
could unlock a new paradigm of possibilities
for stakeholders across sectors.

ONDC could take financial services deeper
into the ecosystem, delivering credit and
insurance to consumers and businesses who
sorely need it, powering seller growth, and
boosting investments. The open network
could connect more than a billion consumers
seeking financial services and 90 million
MSMEs eager to scale up their operations,
customer base, and offerings.16 The analysis
of financial services takes stock of the
rapidly evolving landscape, opportunities
for further growth (including credit lending,
insurance, and mutual fund and investment
products), and how ONDC could accelerate
digital adoption.

India’s logistics sector is constrained
by infrastructure challenges and higher
logistics costs (11 percent) than in several
countries, such as the BRICS economies.17
ONDC could play a vital role in digitalisation
that increases visibility across the logistics
value chain and makes processes more
efficient. In-depth analysis of the road

transportation industry reveals how ONDC
could directly address barriers to digital
adoption, unlock value, and support
additional business-building opportunities.
Beyond these specific sectors, ONDC’s
unbundling of discrete services creates
opportunities for incumbent companies and
new entrants to shape their participation on
the open network.

ONDC for the world
While ONDC is being tested in India, the
problems it seeks to solve are truly global
in nature. Despite the rise in internet
connectivity around the world, cross-
border trade and digital commerce remain
beyond the reach of many companies,
especially small sellers, as well as billions of
consumers. As the network grows, it could
influence digital commerce on a global
scale in two primary ways: by promoting
cross-border trade and by accelerating and
democratising digital commerce across
markets.

For ONDC to transform digital commerce
beyond the borders of India, four key
enablers should ideally be in place: seamless
cross-border payment settlements,
stringent grievance redressal systems, a
globalised taxonomy, and global cooperation
to support digital commerce.

Getting on board with ONDC
ONDC holds the potential to create open,
inclusive, and competitive marketplaces
in the virtual world. It will be important for
companies to carefully evaluate the options
available to them as they consider entering
this space.

As company leaders explore the possibilities
ahead, they could consider two horizons—
short-term use cases that can help their
companies to participate in the open
network, and a more medium- to long-term
transformation agenda that could help them
innovate and move forward (Exhibit E4).
Companies that follow this path could make
the most relevant investments to achieve
their strategic objectives.

ONDC presents a unique avenue for India to revolutionise its digital
commerce landscape and set an example for the world, much as India
did with the UPI. With vast potential for a robust buyer and seller
ecosystem, ONDC is a rare opportunity that arises once in a decade.
Stakeholders—the government, industry players, and consumers—
can determine how they seize this ‘tech-ade’, putting their best, most
innovative selves forward to democratise digital commerce for all.

India’s ‘tech-ade’:
Unlocking digital-
led growth

I

n an increasingly digital world, India’s
rapid transformation stands out.
Drawn by convenience, knowledge,
and entertainment at their fingertips,

especially during pandemic-induced
lockdowns, Indians have willingly embraced
the internet. While digital adoption has
swiftly swept the country, digital commerce
still has a low share for various reasons.
An open network for digital commerce
could establish inclusive and competitive
marketplaces online, creating choice and
opportunity for everyone, by everyone.

India’s internet usage numbers tell the story
of a connected, young country (nearly half
of the population is younger than 25 years
old)18, its people ready to experience novelty
vicariously through their screens. India has

840 million internet users and 600 million
smartphone subscribers, and Indians
transacted $1.5 trillion worth of digital
payments in 2022 alone. The swift pace of
digital adoption has fuelled India’s digital
economy, which accelerated at 2.5 times the
pace of the overall economy in the past five
years (Exhibit 1).

Of the 840 million Indians using the internet,
about 450 million are avid consumers
of digital content, glued to their devices
for an average of seven hours a day for
social media, messaging, entertainment,
and so forth. But only 165 million engage
in digital commerce (buying goods and
services online). India’s low share of digital
commerce, at an average of 7 percent,19 is
below the averages of 25 percent in China20
and 15 percent in the United States.21

Democratisation of data by

back to individuals and

1. Emergence of digital public

infrastructure to unlock digital
inclusion at population scale

Radical innovations are changing how things
get done in India, replacing time-consuming
paperwork and long queues with digital
solutions. Indians can now easily authenticate
their identity with Aadhaar, scan and pay on the
go via the UPI, breeze past highway toll points
with FASTag, and quickly retrieve and store
government-issued digitalised documentation
using a DigiLocker digital locker. These are just
a few highlights of the massive digital public
infrastructure ecosystem emerging in India.
No other country has this sort of ecosystem.

This is the comprehensive DPI that manages
digital identity, payment, and data. It
overcomes challenges related to customer
identification, limited connectivity, elaborate
paperwork, and primarily cash transactions
(Exhibit 2). This infrastructure builds on an
underlying layer of internet connectivity
that has brought 840 million Indians online
on the back of cheap data and pocket-
friendly smartphones, with initiatives such as
BharatNet gradually connecting rural areas.
Aadhaar, the digital identity for every Indian,
enables single-step identity verification for
any transaction. Open utilities such as the
UPI and DigiLocker create a level playing
field for all stakeholders, unlocking access to
digital payments and data for all. Standards,
frameworks, and protocols such as Account
Aggregator facilitate interactions and exchange
of customer data for faster banking processes.

The government is exploring creating a layer
of digital products and services, of which the
Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)
is a part.

Democratising digital commerce in India

These layers form a digital public
infrastructure ecosystem, accessible
for verticals such as financial services,
agriculture, health, B2B/B2C/B2G, logistics,
and education. Indians have embraced these
advantages (Exhibit 3). The number of digital
payments jumped threefold in the past three
years thanks to the rollout of 4G and 5G
networks, cheap data, and the launch of the
UPI. In 2022, UPI transactions increased by
55 percent over the previous year across
50 million merchants and 300 million
users.22 The Co-WIN portal was developed
in just nine months to ensure access to the
COVID-19 vaccine; by December 2022, it
had supported the delivery of 2.2 billion
vaccine doses.23 FASTag penetration surged
from 16 percent in 2017–18 to 96 percent in
2021–22.24

The DIKSHA portal (Digital Infrastructure for
Knowledge Sharing) is a K-12 resource for
teachers and students, offering textbooks,
courses, televised classes, and more.
It has 160 million enrolments, with over
130 million courses completed in more
than 30 languages. DIKSHA kept education
going in India even through the pandemic.25
Similarly, e-Skill India is an e-learning
aggregator with a collection of courses

that are open for India’s youth to learn
relevant skills for improved employment
opportunities. To date, it has nearly 20 lakh
course enrolments.26

These digital public infrastructure initiatives
have aided broad-based inclusion like never
before, breaking down silos and putting the
power of data in the hands of the individual.

2. Rise of private-sector investment
boosting the digital economy
Over the past 15 years, India has seen an
entrepreneurship boom supported by
private capital. India is the world’s third-
largest start-up economy, with 107 unicorns
across digital products and services in
B2B and B2C.27 This growth stems from the
fivefold rise in private equity and venture
capital funding, from $14 billion in 2016 to
$65 billion in 2021.28 One-fifth of all venture
capital funding in the Asia–Pacific region
flowed to India in 2022, further boosting
the digital start-up ecosystem (Exhibit 4).29
Private enterprises are also investing to
build at-scale digital businesses like Jio-
Mart and Tata Digital. This robust private-
sector trend will likely continue fuelling
India’s digital growth.

Digital public infrastructure such as Aadhaar and UPI are groundbreaking initiatives
with the potential to revolutionise India’s digital ecosystem and, in future, the world.
With the JAM trinity, we now have a billion plus Aadhaar cards, nearly a billion bank
accounts and a billion mobile phone connections that have played a foundational
role in making India’s fintech/startup ecosystem one of the most vibrant and fastest
growing in the world. As we move into a digital era, ONDC could become an integral
component of India’s DPI. Its end goal is to democratise commerce, and onboard
millions of merchants (that do not participate on any digital platforms today) to sell
their goods and services online.

17

Democratising digital commerce in India3. Advent of 5G data speeds
Data consumption in India grew by 18
times in the past five years, with data costs
falling and data speeds rising thanks to 4G.
Consumption could grow further with the
advent of 5G connectivity, which promises
ten times faster speed, seamless coverage,
and lower latency for internet users,
encouraging them to keep surfing as they
explore new possibilities and innovations.30

Indian users spend about 35 percent of their
screen time on social media applications.
They are also getting used to “social
commerce,” or shopping on social media;
use of social commerce has tripled in India
since 2019.31 For small businesses, social
commerce offers a direct line to customers,
especially in untapped markets such as tier
2 and tier 3 towns. India’s 450 million social
media users are already a growing base of
potential buyers who can find, research,
and purchase products or services without
exiting social media apps.

Faster internet through 5G could attract
more customers with innovations like video
commerce, live commerce, and chat-led
commerce. These could be significant
bridges to drive digital commerce in a
primarily vernacular country. Augmented
reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) could
allow e-commerce brands to demonstrate
more real-world products on shopping sites.
In China, the social commerce market size
in 2021 was $370 billion (nearly 15 percent
of e-commerce sales), with over 800 million
participants.32 In India, faster internet speed
is projected to boost social commerce from
$3 billion in 2022 to $90 billion by 2030.33

Beyond social commerce, 5G will likely have
a transformative impact on India’s diverse
and hard-to-reach population. Telemedicine,
AI for remote surgery, and VR to simulate
medical scenarios could help doctors in far-
flung areas treat critically ill patients. It could

also extend to other fields, such as aiding
dynamic traffic management for a better,
safer driving experience.

4. Multilingual, conversational AI
technologies to capture the next
wave of internet users

While the first language of the internet
is English, only a fraction of Indians
understand it. Over 95 percent of online
video consumption is in Indian languages.34
As content creators move to match these
preferences, vernacular news content is
expected to grow nearly eight times faster
than English news in number of viewers
and time spent.35 The proportion of regional
languages beyond Hindi in over-the-top
video content could double to 54 percent
by 2024.36 And yet, there is some way
to go to offer more intuitive, seamless
vernacular digital experiences. For example,
while Amazon India is available in multiple
languages, only 5 to 10 percent of all
purchases happened on its non-English-
language platform in 2021.37

The government is investing heavily in
R&D toward this purpose. MeitY’s Bhashini
is a government initiative to capture
India’s 20-plus languages and more than
20,000 dialects for a more sophisticated
conversational AI experience.38 As part of
Project Vaani, Google has partnered with
the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore,
to create an AI-based language model that
understands diverse Indian languages and
dialects.

These advances could feed into creating
vernacular, video-based content and
conversational and generative AI capabilities
such as Chat GPT and DALL-E. Such
shifts could bring greater comfort and
convenience for the next wave of internet
users.

Democratising digital commerce in India

5. Democratisation of data by

giving data back to individuals
and businesses who generate it

India is on a journey to move the power
of data back to those who generate it—
consumers and small businesses. Data
in the physical world has traditionally
been disaggregated and hard to access.
Now, individuals can access, control, and
share their personal data and verifiable
credentials.

A few digital public infrastructure initiatives
make this possible. The Data Empowerment
and Protection Architecture is a consent-
based data-sharing framework39 that lets
individuals share verifiable data such as
Aadhaar, financial information, and health
data with banks and other institutions.
Account Aggregator is a consent-based
financial data-sharing ecosystem with more
than 250 participants. DigiLocker is a single
application to digitally store and retrieve
authentic documents, hugely simplifying
tedious processes such as collecting
required documents for a passport
application.40

Open data can benefit various stakeholders
across public and private institutions. Data
earlier visible to only a few stakeholders
is now available to public and private
institutions. Government institutions can
analyse it to respond with relevant policy
interventions. For example, the GSTN portal
allows over ten million businesses to upload
line-item-level data, helping the government
track GDP consumption in real time.
Consent-based access to individual data or
aggregated level data can make it possible

for small businesses to devise targeted
offerings or reach more customers, such
as financial institutions, who can access
verifiable data through Account Aggregator
for underwriting and lending to previously
unserved customers.

Room for growth in digital
commerce
Low-cost data and smartphones have
made it possible for India to craft its own
digital growth story. The number of internet
users has doubled since 2016,41 and digital
transaction volumes have grown by seven
times since 2019.42 And yet, the share of
digital commerce is just 7 percent of India’s
total retail market.43 The funnel of Indian
online consumers shows a tapering from a
high number of internet users (840 million)
to active consumers of social media and
content (450 million) to a proportionately
small number of digital commerce
transactors, a mere 165 million (Exhibit 5).

In 2021, India ranked eighth among global
economies in the size of its digital commerce
market—which is 7 percent of the total
retail market.44 While this is lower than
China (25 percent)45 and the United States
(14 percent),46 it shows rapid growth, given
these two countries have nearly a decade’s
head start over India in online commerce.

Bringing the next 500 million consumers and
100 million sellers to trade online could grow
digital commerce in India. Some ground
realities, explained next, are keeping them
from adopting digital commerce.

Democratising digital commerce in India

Only a fraction of internet users
regularly shop online

Of the 165 to 190 million consumers47 who
already use digital commerce, a much
smaller number (about ten to 15 million) are
power users, typically living in urban areas
and shopping across sectors (Exhibit 6).
The majority shops in a few segments,
mostly fashion, mobility, or electronics.
Another divide is the rural-urban gap. While
nearly 65 percent of internet users from the
top eight cities shop online, the figure for
rural India is less than 5 percent (Exhibit 7).48

Potential consumers who have internet
access often shy away from digital
commerce, generally lacking comfort with
or trust in online shopping. Sometimes this
is due to the lack of comfort with English-
language platforms—the convenience
that keeps consumers hooked to digital
content could encourage them to try digital
commerce as well. When comfort or trust
is lacking, customers much prefer the
experience of in-person shopping (even
of local, unbranded products) at a familiar,
nearby store where they feel the shop
owner offers the comfort of advice and
accountability, and with whom the customer
may have a long personal association.

47  Expert interviews.
48 Based on population data from the 2011 census.

This is especially true for the largest
consumption segment, grocery. Non-
standardised products, easy access to a
wide assortment of merchandise at nearby
physical stores, and low ticket sizes mean
that the grocery sector has just a 1 to
2 percent share of the digital commerce
market. Up to 70 percent of shopper
journeys in this segment are same-day trips
for a daily top-up or impulse purchases.
The convenience of a quick grocery run or a
phone call for fast, hyperlocal delivery keeps
consumers offline: same-day delivery via
hyperlocal grocery players is an option in
only 20 to 25 cities in India.

Differences across sectors affect the
uptake of digital commerce. In contrast to
grocery, electronics has about a 35 percent
share of the digital commerce market,
with standardised products, a wider online
assortment, and high ticket sizes that absorb
logistics costs.

The purchase of high-demand skilled
services performed by workers such as
carpenters, plumbers, and beauticians, and
of unskilled labour such as domestic help, is
largely undigitised beyond the top ten cities.
The same goes for mobility needs—tickets
for buses, local trains, autos, and taxis are
physically purchased in most Indian cities.

1 Based on population data from census2011.co.in

Less than 5 million of 100 million
MSMEs are registered to sell on
e-commerce platforms

The insufficient presence of B2C and B2B
sellers, as well as of independent skilled
professional service workers, is a factor in
the low share of digital commerce in India.

B2C sellers

While about 65 to 70 percent of India’s
100 million MSMEs or small businesses have
internet connectivity, only 5 to 6 percent can
sell on digital platforms, and even fewer get
meaningful business online (Exhibit 8).

Sellers, particularly in rural areas, lack
either digital access or the knowledge to
confidently use digital platforms for trade.
Even those interested in selling online are
deterred by the high cost of digitalising
inventory and sorting out or paying for
related infrastructure such as warehousing
and logistics. They struggle to access capital
to modernise or expand—the credit gap
for MSMEs in India is about $300 billion—
driving about 60 percent of business owners
to opt for informal credit at prohibitive cost.49
Even when MSMEs join a selling platform,

existing algorithms and filters often obscure
their presence, by default favouring sellers
who can operate at scale, offer low prices,
and consistently maintain stock in several
locations. Consumers are less likely to find
the smaller sellers, who are ill-equipped to
stay competitive and visible.

B2B sellers

Business-to-business sellers lag far behind
the global average of 20 percent when it
comes to digital penetration (Exhibit 9).
The entrenched distributor system in retail
trade provides credit to customers and
offers prices equivalent to those of digital
B2B marketplaces. For B2Bs, the margins
from participating in online platforms are
thin. Many retailers and distributors are also
wary of the system, fearing fraud, especially
with large and recurring transactions.
Compounding these concerns is the
fact that global B2B companies have not
invested in India to build an ecosystem that
might benefit local companies. Limited
standardisation or certification for different
product categories makes it difficult to
digitalise the product category.

Self-employed workforce

Independent professionals or unorganised
labour force offering skilled services
also need to be discoverable over digital
commerce platforms. The Indian economy
has largely been informal, with an
unorganised labour force of around 380 to
400 million. Only around 8 to 10 million of the
workforce are on digital platforms.50 In the
current postpandemic economic scenario,
many professionals have left or had to leave
the organised workforce. Rising internet
speeds enable remote service offerings that
were previously unimaginable. Telemedicine,
remote surgery, and upskilling could all
create opportunities for self-employed
individuals, and a unified, decentralised,
low-cost, reliable digital ecosystem could
provide such workers the necessary boost.

Platform unit economics remains
a challenge
Despite the massive scale of India’s
population, platform unit economics remains
a challenge in multiple sectors. Most notable

platforms themselves face the economic
fallout of deep discounts and high consumer
acquisition costs, leading to a higher cost
of growth. Consumers have not yet shown
their ability or willingness to absorb supply
chain costs (30 to 100 rupees per order),
especially for smaller orders.51

India has an incredibly efficient,
disaggregated, and often informal supply
chain across distributors, wholesalers, and
shop-led delivery. Reimagining the digital
commerce supply chain to incorporate these
strengths could transform the business case
for digital commerce.

The barriers to a vibrant digital commerce
ecosystem can be brought down.
Some changes, such as faster internet,
multilingual and AI-powered conversational
interfaces, and private investment in digital
infrastructure, are already underway.
The vast DPI and democratised access to
data could power an “open network”, that
eliminates the barriers to digital commerce
adoption by creating a level and inclusive
playing field for all buyers and sellers.

50  https://labour.gov.in/unorganized-workers
51  Expert conversations.

The Indian consumer is highly aspirational: connected for many hours a day to
the mobile screen, she is now aware of all that is on offer in the bigger cities.
Availability, however, lags aspiration. E-commerce has been a big enabler to
bridge this gap but sectors like grocery and personal care need a different solve
that can profitably go deeper than the top 200–300 cities and enable wider
consumer access to the assortment. ONDC could enable a significant increase in
consumption by bridging the gap between aspiration and availability.

Principles of open network

The concept of an open network to democratise digital access
An “open network,” as the name suggests,
could allow market access regardless of
the platforms and applications used by the
buyers or sellers. It is neither owned by a
single company nor limited to a particular
company’s products (Exhibit 10). An early
example of an open network is the internet,
where multiple servers connect to one
another on the World Wide Web, and search
engines curate results using all relevant
information fetched from an endless array of
sources.

Unbundled: Breaking down of
complex systems into granular
activities or micro services, such
as in an e-commerce transaction;
different entities can take up
seller, logistics, payments, and
buyer-side activities.

Interoperable: Network
participants work together
without being configured to any
single platform.

Decentralised: Data availability
and control of agreeing
transactions are at both the
buyer and seller ends.

Democratising digital commerce in India

The UPI has all three of these characteristics. Its success proves how open networks
can unlock the opportunities for massive participation in India’s digital economy by
democratising access for all consumers. The launch of the UPI was an inflection point in the
country’s payments history. Transaction volumes quintupled between 2019 and 2022, and
transaction value grew by ten times over the past four years to reach $1.5 trillion in 2022
(Exhibit 11).

India has in the past led the world with
innovative, population-scale initiatives
that disrupt the market, such as Aadhaar
and the UPI. With the UPI, the average
Indian enjoys the power to scan and pay
on the go. Democratising digital commerce
in goods and services—that is, making it
equally available for all Indians through an
open network—could be a transformative,
pioneering move.

The next chapter details the vision and
possibilities of ONDC. This could transform
the landscape and opportunities for
consumers and providers, unlocking digital-
led growth for India’s economy and its
people.

ONDC: A pioneering
initiative

pen Network for Digital
Commerce (ONDC) is a bold
initiative to build an inclusive
digital commerce ecosystem.

O

Success stories of open networks showcase
how ONDC could put India on the cusp of
transformative possibilities for stakeholders
and the economy. The opportunities it
unlocks could accelerate the growth of
digital consumption in India, bringing to life a
vibrant digital commerce universe — bigger,
broader and more inclusive.

An open network where consumers and
providers can transact regardless of the
platform or application they use, ONDC is an
alternative to the current platform-centric
model that aims to:

 — Expand digital commerce as a channel for
all transactions between consumers and
providers.

 — Include all providers of products

and services for both B2C and B2B
commerce.

 — Build multiple rails to the buyer (through
different buyer apps) to connect supply
and demand.

 — Unlock innovations across the ecosystem

by making it inclusive.

ONDC could be the world’s first such digital
commerce ecosystem, putting participants
on an equal footing and powering a faster-
growing digital economy. While the early
ONDC pilots have focused on a few use
cases such as hyperlocal grocery and online
food delivery, some interesting innovations
highlight the diversity of what the network
could offer (Exhibits 12 and 13).

Namma Yatri : Application of open network in mobility.

Namma Yatri is the first open network mobility application built
by JusPay technologies in partnership with Bengaluru auto driver
union to provide multi-modal service without the involvement of
any middlemen.

Key value proposition

• Direct-to-Driver app

• No commission or middle-men i.e.,
whatever consumer pays goes,
100% to the driver and his family

Concept

The application is built on the common
network standards defined by ONDC built
on the Beckn protocol (open source).
The common network standards allow for
interoperability for any buyer app compliant
with the network standards to offer rides

Unified Energy Interface (UEI): Application of open network in electric vehicles.

UEI is a decentralised network for energy transactions to help users
of electric vehicles locate and use charging points. It integrates
charging point information across seven different charging
networks, and offers a single wallet to ease digital payments.

Key value proposition

Concept

• All charging stations now

accessible on 1 app

• A small or big provider

stands an equal chance of
business as accessible
through same open network

• A single UEI certification
replaces the need for
multiple agreements

Key growth metrics

The number of charging networks across India
has increased from 5 to 70+ over the past 2
years. However, each charging network runs a
closed loop wallet leading to challenges like the
need to download 42+ Charge Point Operators
(CPO) apps to operate and pay at different
charging stations, and the lack of a unified view
of chargers for policy makers to take up
appropriate grid planning activities, etc. This has
led the Department of Science and Technology
and industry experts to create a decentralised
and open network for electric vehicle chargers

In these ways, ONDC has the potential to change the game for many stakeholders, from
setting up sustainable market linkages for grassroots artisans to addressing the challenges
of commuting in a sprawling city like Bengaluru. To understand the possibilities ONDC could
unlock, it is important to delve into how it works.

31

Democratising digital commerce in India A glance at the network
Imagine ONDC as a set of gears that swing
into action the moment the consumer
launches an item search through their
preferred buyer app, such as Pincode or
Paytm (Exhibit 14).

The buyer app relays this search query to a
gateway, which searches the ONDC registry.
The gateway identifies relevant sellers and
multicasts the search query to all seller apps.
The apps then fetch product availability
from their respective sellers and relay the
information to the buyer app, which sorts
and displays the most relevant results to the
buyer.

While the buyer app can define the subset of
products and services it wants to be known
for (e.g., hyperlocal grocery and online food
delivery services), it will need to make public
its rules for listing and sorting search results.
This is in keeping with network policies to
ensure a truly democratic marketplace.

The seller might fulfil the order on its own
or use a logistics service discovered via
the network. Depending on the option, the
delivery time and cost are transparently
shown, allowing the buyer to make an
informed choice.

At the back end, a set of network services
keeps ONDC running smoothly, from
registries or applications that maintain the
list of participants to scoring and badging
services that uphold sustainable and
transparent practices on the network.

Together, all these gears interlock for a
tailored outcome based on the consumer’s
preferences.

In 18 months, ONDC has built its presence
in key categories such as grocery, online
food delivery, home décor, and mobility, with
pilots in five major cities—Delhi, Bengaluru,
Meerut, Bhopal, and Coimbatore (Exhibit 15).

The ONDC edge
By virtue of being interoperable, unbundled,
and decentralised, ONDC splits a complex
system into discrete microservices that
different players can offer separately, with
positive outcomes for all. This could be an
alternative to the existing platform-centric
model, in which the platform controls the
buyer and seller journeys end to end, from
provider onboarding, customer acquisition,
and order fulfilment to payments and
complaint resolution.

Across the digital commerce ecosystem,
consumers, providers, and buyer and seller
apps could benefit from an open network in
the following ways:

 — New and niche ways of seller discovery

emerge for consumers. Potential
buyers on ONDC could access a wider
ecosystem of products and services that
is not yet seamlessly available online,
such as locating a nearby carpenter in a
new city or sourcing a handmade carpet
directly from an Agra-based seller. ONDC
could bridge the gap between online and
offline commerce in prices, assortment,
and category availability, from groceries
and transportation to specialised items
and offerings.

 — Providers reach further. Small

businesses, or MSMEs, could be

discoverable by a wider customer base
across different buyer apps with greater
ease at a lower cost. With access to
customer data, these providers could
further scale their online businesses
and tailor relevant new experiences in
both B2B and B2C commerce. Sellers
could also enjoy greater autonomy.
All-network discoverability means that
they can go to their preferred seller
app, the one offering better terms and
commissions. It can also lead to the
growth of out-of-the-box collaborations
across various kinds of partners, such as
financial services providers, technology
solutions providers, logistics partners,
badging agencies, vernacular video
content platforms, and solutions to help
sellers provide end-to-end integrated
e-commerce offerings.

 — Buyer and seller apps get efficient.

These apps could save business costs
as India’s incredibly efficient local and
regional supply chains go digital in rural
and urban areas. When existing supply
chains shift online, they could bring with
them the reputation and trust they have
earned in the past. This would inspire
confidence in their abilities to support
consumers across the value chain and in
newer segments.

33

Democratising digital commerce in India The ONDC lens:

Reimagining

digital commerce

While India has the scope and space to support
both platform-based and open-network-based
commerce, the open network can expand
opportunities across the landscape, as illustrated
by Exhibits 16, 17, 18, and 19. In the fullness of time,
the following ten archetypes of commerce could
take shape on an open network.

01

Boosting the direct-to-

consumer (D2C) ecosystem

Taking financial services

06

further

With the reduced buyer and seller app fees,

sellers could find it financially attractive to

build up D2C brands. Big brands might rethink

their innovation to reach microsegments

directly, and small businesses (for example,

Kanchipuram saree weavers) could find a

national market.

Putting self-employed professionals

02

on the map

Self-employed people could promote

themselves on the open, inclusive

marketplace, attracting attention and

business from newer consumers. It could

be an advantage for skilled workers (e.g.,

lawyers, accountants, and doctors) and

blue-collar workers. ONDC could bring

workers from the unorganised sector

online, connecting them with demand.

03

Digitising B2B commerce

Retailers (such as grocery stores and

pharmacies) could access a wider distribution

network, saving time and costs. Direct linkages

between retailers and manufacturers would be

likely to cut prices, improving margins in

sectors such as agriculture and construction.

04

Amplifying hyperlocal goods and

omnichannel convenience

Digital channels would take the

neighbourhood market (kirana stores,

stationery shops, electronics goods) online

to serve hyperlocal demand, while

omnichannel availability could make it easy

to order from home after checking out a

product at a physical touchpoint (such as an

electronics or clothing store).

Bringing hyperlocal services

05

within reach

Consumers could seek and find a range of

services online, from tailoring to plumbing

to transport. Whether a user needs an

electrician or tickets for a multimodal

journey from home to the office, the

network could offer it all.

Without traditional financial records,

businesses and consumers struggle to secure

credit or qualify for insurance coverage.

ONDC’s transaction-based data could support

innovative new offerings. For example, banks

could track nontraditional metrics to offer

sellers milestone and flow-based financing.

Greater access to credit could address a

range of needs for businesses, including

working capital in B2B (agriculture and

construction, for instance) and supply chain

financing for retailers and wholesalers (for

example, in electronics and fashion).

Growing peer-to-peer

07

commerce

The decentralised platform would eliminate

the need for a middleman between consumer

and provider for peer-to-peer commerce.

Inspired by influencers, consumers could be

excited and inspired to shop through social

media. Peer sellers could offer attractive

purchase options by easily showcasing their

goods and services at negligible cost.

Self-employed professionals such as home

chefs and homestay hosts could easily find

individual consumers for their services.

08

Empowering more people with

education and skills

More learners and workers could access a

skills-based education, vocational training,

career counselling, and knowledge of career

opportunities. Allowing for more equity and

inclusion, this shift could engender a more

equitable, skills-driven labour market in India,

with the ability to upskill and seek

employment available to all on an open

network.

Making logistics efficient

09 Once digitalised, the entire supply chain

could improve price visibility, including for

shippers, fleet owners, and operators across

rural and urban India. Higher delivery volumes

could bring down logistics costs with

batching and multimodal deliveries through

multiple provider options at each stage.

Taking India to the world

10 India’s vibrant internal trade could also ramp

up globally. The digital commerce

infrastructure could promote cross-border

trade via marketplaces, particularly helping

MSMEs become discoverable by global

consumers and businesses.

Building an inclusive marketplace
From the toymaker operating at his village home to the pan-India retailer, every kind of player
could participate in an open network without needing to build the entire ecosystem on their
own. ONDC could also enable specialisation, with each player bringing their own strengths,
innovations, and unique offerings (Exhibit 20).

There is a high cost of compliance and being included in the formal economy. As a result, the
millions of individuals who run businesses of one—shopkeepers, electricians, beauticians,
daily wagers, house helps, etc.— appear in the population and identity counts of the
country, but are invisible on the larger economic map of India. The opportunity of ONDC is to
connect these individual businesses, ensuring their inclusion in India’s digital consumption
landscape, enabling formalised credit and ensuring they thrive and are not marginalised.

Democratising digital commerce in India

Spurring on a fast-growing economy
India’s digital consumption is poised to grow to as much as $340 billion by FY30. ONDC
could accelerate this growth across multiple parameters (Exhibits 21 and 22). By the end of
this decade, India’s digital commerce users could number 500 million, with six to seven times
more MSMEs online than today, ten times the number of self-employed workers, and four to
five times greater consumption of digital products and services.

In the future: A combinatorial
explosion of possibilities
Over time, as ONDC scales up, it could
emerge as a network of networks,
unleashing a combinatorial explosion
(Exhibit 23). The innumerable permutations
and combinations possible in such an
interconnected network could unleash
possibilities that are hard to imagine.

India could exceed expectations for the
growth and possibilities of digital commerce
with ONDC. The network could evolve into a
nerve centre of new connections, sparking
continuous innovation and advances.
However, there are multiple challenges to
address to allow ONDC to scale and achieve
greater momentum for success.

Democratising digital commerce in India


Building trust
and scale

NDC could have a transformative
impact on consumers, sellers,
technology service providers
and the country. This could be

O

a huge achievement for India, a country
already known globally for high levels of
digital adoption despite per capita incomes
lower than those of many other economies.
For this pioneering initiative to work, it will
be critical to establish trust and scale—a
high-trust environment and widespread
adoption could make all the difference
between potential and reality. There can be
no substitute for a good experience to build

trust, and a new concept like ONDC needs to
build early traction and scale in an impatient
digital world.

Executives of large, thriving companies
and bootstrapped start-ups, traditional
companies and tech-led disrupters all agree
that what ONDC is trying to do has never
been attempted, and that it is taking on a
very complex situation. Trust and scale will
be mutually reinforcing attributes that could
define the success of this huge network.

45

Democratising digital commerce in India Fostering an environment of
mutual trust
The willingness of consumers to use
ONDC-linked buyer apps will depend
on their experience with the network.
A core characteristic of the open network
is that it unbundles a series of services
that would otherwise be unified on a
single platform. Multiple participants
deliver their respective components in the
value chain. While allowing for individual
margins and profitability, each of these
participants needs to deliver to a high
standard. One weak link in the entire chain,
or one underperforming entity, can bring
the customer experience crashing down.

Proactive complaint resolution and stringent
policies could be crucial to foster a trusted
environment that safeguards customer
interests.

The success of ONDC would turn on
ensuring a trust-based environment and
seamless experience across the customer
journey, including search and discovery,
order placement and fulfilment, payments
and reconciliation, and returns and
customer grievances. Exhibits 24 and 25
capture the process and flow of information
in an unbundled value chain for the first
two steps of the customer journey: search
and discovery, and order placement and
fulfilment.

Democratising digital commerce in India Multiple challenges exist across the
customer journey in an unbundled
environment, where no one player controls
the end-to-end value chain. Exhibit 26 lays
out a few such challenges and outlines
how ONDC could address them. It would
require a mix of clear network policies,
enhanced and optimised API definitions,
and innovations in third-party tools and
solutions.

ONDC also has a structured redressal
system to ensure just and timely raising and
redressal of customer issues, as outlined

in Exhibit 27. It has a three-step escalation
matrix (classifying the problem into an issue,
grievance, or dispute depending on the
escalation level and resolution timelines)
with defined service-level agreements and
response rates across each of the three
steps. The seamless and timely working
of this redressal system is critical to the
success of the network.

ONDC could also establish its leadership as
a trusted network by fostering new ideas
and disseminating best practices to enhance
customer experience.

Protocol optimisation to reduce data payload between participants

Guidelines to capture what attributes are synced in real-time
(e.g., price, quantity, store level serviceability), what attributes are
cached (e.g., product features & images) and what is displayed at
first render

Flagging mechanism for incorrect or poor-quality search results

Cataloguing-as-a-service for small sellers to help digitalise
inventory and provide accurate data to network participants

Catalogue scoring mechanism to ensure high quality (automated)

Sector-specific taxonomy defined for specific search

Search-as-a-service to improve accuracy and correctness of
search intent

Transparency in terms and conditions through a digitally-executed
transaction-level contract for every transaction on the network

Contract adherence through network mechanisms (e.g. IGM),
ensuring timely and effective resolution of issues

Serviceability solution – A digital tool for seller apps to embed to
decide serviceability of a location (based on road-distance & current
traffic, time and geographic considerations)

Response time seller apps may vary;
consumer experience gets hampered
due to non-predictability of
response time

Buyer apps may like to cache
results to improve speed of
searches. However, caching by
buyer app runs the risk of
displaying out-of-date results

Quality of data sent by seller apps
not sufficient for buyer app
standards for filtering and
displaying data

Seller apps need search intent to
provide meaningful results; buyer
apps need granular information to
slice & dice results

Ordering

fulfilment

Given the distributed nature of the
network, building trust through
contracts is essential given there is
no face time between consumers
and sellers

Seller apps will need to build more
innovative ways to determine
serviceability. The road distance
may be significantly longer than the
radial distance between consumer
and seller, resulting in
unserviceability

Building scale
For the network, having sufficient
participants could help to unlock network
benefits such as simplified, efficient logistics
and lower customer acquisition costs. It
could also encourage providers to invest in
the capabilities required, such as inventory
digitalisation.

ONDC could gain traction or scale by
addressing the barriers to digital commerce
for consumers and providers. It will be
crucial for ONDC to play a market-making

role and enable multiple other participants
to scale. It will also be important to build a
mix of shapers who can invest in developing
the ecosystem. They could include large,
influential companies as well as innovative
young organisations that can push the
boundaries of possibilities and create
new business models. And finally, a few
selected use cases could scale up them
to establish what might be possible. This
could encourage more participants to join
the market, creating a virtuous cycle of
participation.

01

Attract consumers by focusing on
goods and services more frequently
purchased

ONDC and network participants could concentrate on
high-frequency and relevant use cases that would be
most meaningful for potential consumers. ONDC could
power early wins by diving deep into select categories
and geographies with a focus on a few use cases, such
as buying tickets for an entire commute through a single
interface or lending and embedded financing in credit.

02

Bring providers on board multiple
networks

To build scale more rapidly, ONDC could integrate
with other government initiatives such as account
aggregators, Government e-Marketplace (GeM), and
Unified Logistics Interface Platform. ONDC has also
introduced economic incentives for buyer apps, seller
apps, and providers that reach transaction-based
milestones on the network.

03

Remove barriers that restrict providers
from going online

Seller apps need to invest in creating awareness about
the channel and removing their barriers to onboarding
(for example, the challenges of digitalising inventory,
resistance to formalising businesses, and a lack of
technological savviness). They could create content that
promotes the benefits of participation and provide
additional resources to support providers throughout the
onboarding process. They could also engage in
partnerships with third-party tech players (such as
companies that offer cataloguing as a service) to facilitate
the onboarding of small providers. Third-party scoring
and certification programs could offer providers rewards
or improved ratings for inventory digitisation and
fulfilment. The result would be a virtuous cycle of more
providers on the network.

04

Offer a viable economic model that
improves on the unit economics on
platforms

Participants could find ONDC a viable and sustainable
network on which to remain only if they are turning a
profit. A robust economic model could be critical to
creating this profitability for network participants and
making ONDC self-sufficient to support a gradual,
eventual scale-up. It could be important for ONDC to
explore multiple commercial models for its own
operations, such as flat fees, subscription models,
and transaction commissions, to ensure that the
network is viable as it scales and that its participants
are self-sufficient.

Focusing on deepening trust and building scale could be
critical for ONDC to have a meaningful impact. The outcomes
could manifest differently for different sectors. The next
chapter explores the potential of ONDC to transform the
digital commerce environment in a series of sectors.

Grocery

Grocery accounts for 35-45 percent
of India’s consumer spending and is
valued at approximately $400 billion.1
India’s online grocery penetration is
1 to 2 percent, substantially lagging
behind other product categories such as
electronics and fashion.2 The landscape
is experiencing a twin disruption,
however, with the market becoming more
organised on the one hand and more
digitalised on the other.

ONDC can accelerate this momentum
by digitally enabling local kiranas (small
grocery shops) and putting one of the
world’s largest fragmented trade bases
at the heart of India’s digitalisation story.

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape
India’s grocery sector, with 12 million stores,
accounts for 35 to 45 percent53 of consumer
spending and plays a significant role in
conveniently fulfilling the daily needs of the
country’s population. In fiscal year 2022, the
Indian grocery sector totalled approximately
$400 billion—a figure projected to grow at
a CAGR of 6 percent over the coming years
(Exhibit 29).

As multiple digital commerce platforms
evolve from focusing on customer

acquisition to growing transaction
frequency, e-grocery has been gaining
traction. It received a further boost in recent
years with the pandemic forcing people to
stay home. And the changing preferences
of consumers seeking omnichannel
experiences and instant delivery are driving
the growth of e-grocery. A thriving supply
and delivery ecosystem has emerged with
multiple modes. Customers can choose
one- to two-day warehouse-based delivery
(dry and fresh products or purely staples-
oriented plays). Or they can opt for quick

Democratising digital commerce in India commerce delivery (within 1-2 hours)
through players who have emerged either as
extensions of online food delivery or stand-
alone players operating from hyperlocal
dark stores.

Despite this upward swing, the share of
digital commerce in the Indian grocery
industry remains low (Exhibit 30)—just
1-2 percent, compared with other global
markets such as China (19 percent),
the United States (11 percent), and the
United Kingdom (13 percent). Digital
penetration across segments within the
grocery sector varies greatly: for example,
e-grocery penetration rates for staples
(0.5 to 1 percent) and super-fresh items
(0.3 to 0.5 percent) are lower than for
personal and home care products (2.5 and
3.0 percent respectively).

This limited penetration is unsurprising—
India’s 12 million kirana stores offer a
convenience that is hard to match, along
with a personalised shopping experience
built on close, enduring customer
relationships. Kirana stores are also unique
in offering occasional credit for a month at
a time.

Around 65 percent of grocery sales come
from daily top-up and impulse purchases,
whereas these purchases drive only
25 percent of e-grocery sales (Exhibit 31).
This journey has not been digitalised beyond
the top 20 to 30 cities in India, where quick
commerce has taken market share away
from e-commerce, highlighting the need to
speedily fulfill grocery demand.

It is important to acknowledge that while modern retail formats are here to stay and
grow, kirana stores are the fabric of the Indian grocery ecosystem. Even during the
challenging times of Covid, the neighborhood kiranas showed their resilience and agility
in modifying their assortment, managing the broken supply chains, and continuing to
serve the customers. ONDC holds the promise to transform India’s e-commerce sector
by creating an opportunity for millions of kiranas to participate in the digital economy.
As a company that counts millions of small stores as its partners, HUL is committed to
supporting ONDC and helping it reach its full potential. We believe that ONDC will foster
innovation, collaboration, and inclusion in India’s digital commerce ecosystem.

Digitalisation and the open network could help midsize kiranas increase take-home profit by
around 13 to 15 percent. This boost could be attributed primarily to a 20 to 25 percent growth
in top-line revenue due to rising hyperlocal demand (Exhibit 33).

2 Unit economics is for an online order.
3 Buyer app incurs costs in marketing, employee, IT, and customer servicing, whereas the seller app incurs costs in kirana digitalisation and

management, employee, and IT. Given thin margins, buyer apps could consider grocery as a traffic-generating sector to enhance customer
engagement and seek to cover costs from ad revenue from the brands to reduce the fee to kirana further, thereby improving the kirana
economics online.

Generate demand

Improve cataloguing

There is a need to create a standardised catalogue
to ensure that the brand design, representation, and
detail can be easily replicated by multiple sellers.

05
Enhance logistics capabilities

Delivery partners could establish multipoint
pick-up capabilities at lower costs, while stores
could develop their capabilities for short-distance
deliveries.

Buyer apps must mobilise their existing user base
to search for their favourite hyperlocal products to
drive adoption of a new buyer interface. Financial
institutions could help draw customers by offering
monthly credit.

02
Digitalise inventory

Seller apps could take the lead in driving store
digitalisation across both kiranas and wholesale.
They could begin by leveraging modern retail, stand-
alone modern trade (SAMT), and company dark
stores or distributors with digitalised inventory to
manage product availability. Real-time conversational
order acceptance at the kirana level could be
implemented over time. A convenient and efficient
way to digitalise the small grocery stores inventory
would be a big unlock.

03
Manage change effectively

Seller apps could encourage both the kirana and
wholesale traders to adopt e-grocery by creating a
compelling case for change, that includes structured
incentives and formal credit at fair rates.

Ramping up digitalisation with local kiranas could transform
the momentum of e-grocery in India. With a strong focus on
enablers for digital commerce, ONDC could unlock this
immense potential for the country’s economy and people.

63

Democratising digital commerce in India 4.2
Fashion &
Lifestyle

India’s fashion and lifestyle sector
could double by fiscal year 2030 to a
market size of $220 billion. The rapid
growth of digital commerce, at a CAGR
of around 28 percent during this period,
could create an even more vibrant
sector that makes space for a range of
stakeholders—from the largest brands
to the smallest independent sellers and
from big-city buyers to small-town and
village-based customers.

64

Democratising digital commerce in India

Digital commerce penetration is also
significantly skewed towards tier-1 markets
(around 30 percent), with only 5 percent
penetration in tier-2+ markets. Things could
change dramatically by the end of this
decade if digital commerce grows at the
projected rate of 26 to 28 percent, soaring to
a third of the overall market size (more than
35 percent).

This growth could also stem from the
growing clout of the influencer ecosystem
(57 percent of fashion and beauty brands
use influencers to promote their products).
Around 86 percent of women in India turn
to social media for purchasing advice
before buying branded fashion products.56
Social commerce would showcase both the
inspiration and the opportunity to shop on
online platforms, especially for celebrity- or
entertainment-led merchandise.

The landscape
India’s fashion market—historically
unorganised—has evolved quickly,
with around 35 percent of the fashion
market organised and 10 to 11 percent
now digitalised.54

The rapid growth of digital commerce is
blurring the boundaries of style that would
otherwise separate large and small towns.
Trend-based, fast-fashion brands are
bringing runway styles to the consumer
within weeks, and Instagram influencers are
educating a new wave of fashion consumers
in novel trends.

As new brands emerge to define their own
styles and language, a wider, more inclusive
marketplace could allow them to grow out of
the boundaries of a platform and compete
head-to-head with private labels. A plethora
of diverse providers—ranging from haute
couture to mass-clothing designers and
supported by a vast network of bespoke
fashion players (tailors, dry cleaners, and
embroiderers)—form the backbone of local
fashion markets. India’s fashion and lifestyle
sector is valued at approximately $110 billion
and could double to $220 billion by fiscal
year 2030, with the fastest growth expected
in the online segment (Exhibit 34).

The ability to shop online can transform
wardrobes regardless of geography
and demographics. However, only 10 to
11 percent of fashion commerce takes place
digitally.55 The United States and China
were at that number nearly eight years ago
through significant investments in digital
commerce by players such as Amazon and
Alibaba and offline retailers expanding to
omnichannel play.

Barriers to digital commerce

Potential use-cases

• The return rate of 25 to 30

percent for online purchases is a
massive challenge for fashion
retailers (versus 8 percent for
general merchandise):

⎻

⎻

Sellers face high costs due to
full-refund policies on returned
products and additional logistics
costs to pick up the returns.

Instances of wrong product
returns and unsettled claims
can sometimes result in a
write-off and loss for the seller.

Brands and
channels

• Commissions affect the thin

margins for smaller brands and
sellers.

• Sellers also face stiff competition
as leading marketplace private
labels have captured a significant
volume of the online fashion
market.

• Operational and financial hassles

pose challenges to online
business. For example, sellers
need to digitalise and update their
inventory regularly and maintain
minimum inventory requirements
online for order fulfillment.1

• Sellers might need help

competing on prices and
managing working capital for
everyday costs.

Consumers

• Many customers are discouraged
by the inability to try on items
when shopping online, especially
for high-ticket items or categories
where fit is crucial but is hard to
assess online, e.g., suits and
trousers require personalisation.4

• Leading technology providers on the network could
offer customers features such as virtual try-on and
recommendations, potentially lowering the return
rate.

• Seller apps could digitise and onboard bespoke
fashion providers that offer tailoring services to
customers to reduce returns and cut logistics
costs.2

• Cost synergies with the existing business for the
buyer and seller apps could reduce take rates and
grow profit margins for brands and sellers. Buyer
and seller apps could utilise a portion of human
resources (e.g., technology, HR, and finance teams)
and infrastructure (e.g., customer support, IT, office
spaces, etc.) from existing businesses to save costs.

• The growth of eB2B could help sellers to discover

more business partners (e.g., retailers could
discover wholesalers or manufacturers offering the
best prices, and vice versa) to fulfill just-in-time
orders and prevent lost sales.

• Digitalised stores could enable an omnichannel play

for higher seller discoverability and customer
mindshare – increasing seller competitiveness
(Exhibit 35).

• D2C brands that register as a seller app on the

network could gain higher traffic from multiple buyer
apps without significant marketing spend.3

• An open network and new age selling formats such
as social/video commerce could give smaller sellers
in Tier 3 and 4 towns, market information on the
latest fashion trends, helping them to update their
inventory and remain competitive.

• Based on historical data, financial institutions on the
network could offer credit to sellers to meet their
working capital requirements.

• Enhanced omnichannel play could provide the

convenience of discovering the nearest offline
store to try on products before purchase.

• Vibrant social commerce and the P2P ecosystem

enabled by resellers and influencers could empower
the customer to make a more informed purchase
decision via the online channel.

• Technology features such as virtual try-on present
on the network could attract customers to shop
online.

• Customers could consider buying high-ticket items
with access to finance options (e.g., EMI, BNPL)
from credit lending institutions on the network.

1 At times, certain SKUs may require a minimum of 10 units in stock.
2 Seller/ seller apps could provide customers with coupons to promote local tailoring so they could save logistics costs on returns.
3 Cost of lead generation on a D2C website would be higher as compared to that on the network that diverts traffic from buyer apps.
4 Digital penetration of men’s formal wear is only ~3% currently.

01

Explore more interactive and
exciting ways to sell fashion

With the power of fast internet, sellers could
innovate to attract customers—for example,
through live commerce, an immersive experience
that invites potential buyers to interact and
engage, via make-up tutorials or interviews with
style icons. In China, a leading short-video social
platform converted sales through livestreaming,
with a closed loop for transactions on branded
stores.

03

Handle returns effectively

Seller apps could train sellers to properly verify and
process returned products (for example, immediate
dry-cleaning to make the product resale ready).
Buyer apps could also use historical data across
the network to create customer profiles, assess
their likelihood of returning purchases, and possibly
apply tailored charges for returns.

02
Support sellers to digitalise
inventory

04
Design a robust customer
interface

Seller apps could take the lead to support sellers
on complex skills, such as digitalising the inventory
management process. Technology service providers
on the network could also offer services such as
cataloguing,1 photoshoots and tax management,
and customer-relationship-management offerings
to facilitate smooth online business.

The customer experience is at the heart of online
fashion, and the buyer app defines this experience.
Buyer apps could build a best-in-class team of
industry experts and technical/IT professionals to
offer a world-leading, competitive customer
experience. They could also collaborate with
leading marketing agencies to design attractive
campaigns to convert and retain customers.

Deeply personal and aspirational, fashion
shopping could receive a tremendous boost
through an enhanced digital commerce
experience—creating opportunities for
buyers and sellers and changing how Indians
engage with fashion trends.

1 Service providers could share a catalog score with the sellers with action items so they could improve their online presence.

Electronics

Consumer electronics is a popular
segment for digital commerce, with
32 to 34 percent of transactions
conducted online. The $75 billion
market (FY22) could double to reach
$150 billion by 2030, especially if the
untapped potential for digital commerce
is unlocked.

Changing this could unleash an exciting
new wave of growth. With ONDC, digital
commerce could give retailers in small
cities and towns wider reach across all
consumers for sale of electronic goods
in India.

70

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape
The consumer electronics sector in India has
been growing steadily. As an example, India
has the world’s second-largest smartphone
market (after China), with approximately
600 million smartphone users. India’s
consumer electronics market is expected to
double from about $75 billion in fiscal year
2022 to more than $150 billion by fiscal year
2030 (Exhibit 36).

Much of the projected growth is expected
to come from digital commerce and
from modern retail players. These two
segments are projected to grow at a CAGR
of 12 to 14 percent until fiscal year 2030,
far outpacing general trade’s growth of
approximately 2 percent.

Democratising digital commerce in India The digital commerce penetration in the
industry is 32 to 34 percent, with tier-two
or smaller markets accounting for nearly
65 percent of online orders compared
with around 50 percent just two years
ago.57 This growth stems from product
standardisation, online availability of a
wider range of products, a growing number
of shoppers from smaller towns, improved
delivery timelines and overall customer
experience, and the rise of social commerce
to influence purchase decisions.

The constraints, too, remain—customers’
inability to try out products before
purchasing and concerns about the
quality of after-sales service impede the
growth of digital commerce. This is also a
consolidated market, with a small number
of sellers generating 60 percent of online
sales. ONDC could help to change that by
bringing buyers and sellers from India’s small
towns and villages into the fold of digital
commerce, reaching for parity with global
peers such as China, the United Kingdom,
and the United States (Exhibit 37).

Potential use-cases

• High customer acquisition costs make
it difficult to scale direct-to-consumer
(D2C) channels. Both traditional and
digital-first brands rely on aggregators
for more than 90 percent of their GMV
and are increasingly looking to grow
their D2C reach.

• Registering as a seller or seller app on the network

could bring the D2C brand traffic from multiple buyer
apps at a potentially lower marketing spend.1

• The network could enhance customer experience by
allowing the ability for cross-model comparison,
something that a D2C website cannot do.

• Small sellers find it hard to compete in

• The open network could also make it possible for

an aggressive price market.

• Small sellers are unable to dynamically

change prices.2

Channel
(Distributors
and retailers)

channel participants to be cost-efficient and increase
profitability.

A greater omnichannel play could increase store
footfall, boosting both online and offline sales.

Synergies with the existing business for buyer and
seller apps could lead to cost savings that could be
passed on to the sellers.3
Digitalisation of the wholesale/in-store inventory
could boost eB2B and help retailers easily discover
the best-priced wholesalers.

Enhanced availability and discovery could boost
community group buying, particularly from smaller
towns, which could result in the consolidation of
orders served at a potentially lower cost with a
more efficient supply chain.

• The open network could allow small sellers to discover
the best-priced technology professionals to support
them with a pricing strategy for competitive advantage
online.

• Resellers could discover quality certification agencies

at the best price that could verify and certify their
products to enhance their credibility online (Exhibit 38).

Consumer

• The inability to try out or experience
products could discourage a segment
or long tail of consumers from online
purchases, particularly in the case of
more expensive categories such as
$400-plus mobile phones.

• Concerns about damage-free delivery,
especially for high-value bulky items,
and after-sales services (such as
installation and grievance redressal)
pushes consumers to shop from
physical stores.

• Lack of access to credit could also be a

constraint.

• An enhanced omnichannel offering could allow

consumers to try products at the nearest store and
then buy online for a more informed purchase
decision.

• The aggregation of the seller and product ratings

across buyer apps, as facilitated by the open network,
could strengthen trust.

• Digitalisation of the resale and refurbished products

market on the network could offer the buyer additional
options for price and product discovery.

• Consumers could be more willing to buy when

supported with credit options such as EMI, BNPL, and
discounts.4

1 Brands do not need to register on multiple platforms; by joining the open network as a seller app, the brand could enjoy traffic from all buyer apps
catering to the electronics segment.
2 Sellers charge much higher prices during the initial months of product launch, when most sales happen, and then allow deep discounting.
3 Buyer and seller apps could utilise existing infrastructure (e.g., IT, office space, etc.) and human resources for the new business to realise
some cost savings.
4 Access to consumer data could allow banks and NBFCs to design new financial products and expand their portfolio (win-win for both parties).

01

Catalyse D2C for brands

Buyer apps could benefit from effective
marketing strategies that harness social media
to activate their existing user base. Financing
partners on the network could also ease the
pinch for consumers with flexible payment
options for desirable high-ticket items.

02
Digitalise the inventory

Seller apps on the network could lead the store
digitalisation initiative, particularly in the
general trade segment, to tap into digital
growth momentum. As a start, the seller apps
could target well-known modern retail stores in
urban areas to build credibility and then attract
mom-and-pop stores to their platform.

03

Develop robust logistics
capabilities

Sellers must ensure the safe, secure delivery of high-
value goods over long distances while minimising the
risk of product damage or fraud. One way to achieve
this goal is for brands to use their existing store
infrastructure and provide inventory locally from nearby
stores. Video interactions among sellers, logistics
providers, and consumers could enhance this effort,
improving communication and transparency throughout
the delivery process. Financial-services players could
also contribute with micro-insurance products that
integrate with delivery offerings to provide additional
protection to sellers and consumers.

04
Build a support ecosystem for
resellers and new sellers

First-time sellers and resellers need to establish trust
with consumers on product quality and price. On the
network, low-cost technology service providers could
facilitate this process by certifying the seller’s products
on pricing and quality.

The electronics industry is already well
penetrated online by digital commerce. ONDC
could help offline retailers to compete by
capturing part of the local, digital-first demand.

75

Democratising digital commerce in India 4.4
Online food
delivery

The online food delivery (OFD) sector
in India is on the verge of tremendous
growth. The total market could grow
sixfold to $30 billion by 2030. ONDC
could catalyse this growth by greatly
expanding OFD reach beyond the
largest cities, bringing on board a larger
network of kitchens as well as logistics
and delivery providers to cater to dining
tables in India’s smaller cities. This
push could ramp up order volumes and
choices for customers across India,
transforming the OFD business.

76

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape
Ordering online for doorstep food delivery
has become a way of life in India’s biggest
cities. Hungry diners are scrolling through
their phones in a quest for variety and
convenience at mealtimes. This has led to
rapid growth for the OFD industry, which
earned revenues of more than $5 billion
in FY22. With growing digital literacy,
increasing numbers of dual-income families,
rising disposable incomes, and higher order
frequencies across mealtimes, OFD could
grow sixfold by 2030, achieving revenues of
up to $30 billion (Exhibit 39)58.

But this is not a widespread story. Only
7 percent of internet users in India use OFD,
a significantly lower percentage than in
China (around 50 percent) and the United
States (around 35 percent).59 Orders are
also heavily concentrated in a single meal
(dinner) and from traditional formats such as
chain and stand-alone restaurants, which
together account for more than 95 percent
of GMV. Demand could look very different

Barriers to digital commerce and potential solutions from ONDC.

Barriers to digital commerce

Potential use-cases

• Small restaurants with low margins

find themselves unable to
digitalise profitably. They often
don’t meet the criteria for listing
and also often struggle with
discoverability.

• Potential savings could be unlocked due to a
reduction in performance marketing costs (by
monetising existing user bases) and
operational costs (by using existing
manpower and tech resources) for buyer
apps.

Restaurants

• Restaurants lack the ability to
access or strategically use
customer data that might help
them refine future marketing
strategies.

• Aggregators stretched by peak
volumes in the top four cities.

• The cost of maintaining a delivery

fleet in smaller cities is high due to a
low concentration of demand.

Logistics

• Restaurants in the organised and

unorganised sectors could go online (with
the help of point-of-sale providers) to build
or expand their business.

• With an open network, each restaurant could

gain access to granular customer data,
empowering it to regulate and refine its
marketing spend and product offerings on
buyer apps.

• Digitalised transaction history and scoring
models could enable credit access for
eateries in the unorganised sector.

• The growth of hyperlocal logistics

marketplaces coupled with aggregation of
demand across multiple use cases (e.g.,
grocery, electronics delivery) could address
the challenges of peak capacity requirements
in large cities and low demand concentration
in smaller towns for online food delivery
aggregators.

• Logistics marketplaces could provide new
opportunities for local delivery partners,
creating employment and supporting
economic growth in both urban and rural
areas.

• Online list prices can be 30-50%

• Lower performance marketing and

Customers

•

In Tier-3+ cities, there is a lack of

operational costs for the buyer app could
reduce commissions, with consequently
lower list prices.

• Availability of a wide variety of sellers,
including home chefs, could create a
multitude of choices (Exhibit 40).

Ensure that customer experience
is at par with current platforms

Democratise visibility for all
business archetypes

Restaurants will gain the benefits of ONDC only
when a large number of customers switch to buyer
apps on the network. To attract customers,
developers could improve their apps by offering
user-friendly interfaces, a smooth customer
experience comparable to platform apps (the
existing alternative), and even specific customer-
experience features such as correctly tagging
restaurant and meal-related information and
displaying dynamic delivery times.

Buyer apps could optimise their search algorithms to
display P2P and non-chain restaurants based on
customer needs (for example, meal preferences and
fulfilment ratings) rather than overall ratings and
advertising spend. This would provide a fair
experience for newer business archetypes such as
home chefs who compete with the more established
restaurants.

02
Scale up logistics capabilities to
meet demand

04
Support digitalisation of small
restaurants and home chefs

Logistics players need to meet the anticipated
growth in demand with adequate scale and capacity.
Third-party logistics providers such as Pidge could
optimise the three-sided marketplace (restaurants,
delivery personnel, and customers) within time-
constrained delivery guidelines, matching orders
based on food readiness, timing, and the availability
of delivery personnel.

Seller apps could support small eateries and home
chefs through easy-to-use interfaces that assist with
onboarding, inventory management, and pricing.
Seller apps could also provide verification and
assistance to home chefs (and small eateries) to
acquire the credentials and certifications necessary
to transact online.

Attention to these enablers could help the
online food delivery landscape emerge as a
vibrant ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders.

Pharmaceuticals

Crucial to health, vitality, and well-being for Indians,
domestic pharmaceuticals is one of the fastest-
growing sectors in the country. It is estimated to grow
at a pace of 10 to 11 percent, doubling from around
$21 billion in fiscal year 2022 to $45 to 47 billion in
fiscal year 2030.  Supportive factors are likely to
prompt tenfold growth for the online market over the
next eight years, compared to 1.5x to 1.8x growth
for the offline market. And yet, digital commerce
penetration in the sector is far from the level of global
peers. There is immense scope for an open network
to change that dynamic and power even greater
growth for the online pharma market.

82

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape
In the fiscal year 2022, the Indian domestic
retail pharmaceutical market was valued at
about $21 billion, with the digital commerce
segment accounting for about $1 billion.
The online pharmacy market could grow
at a CAGR of around 33 to 35 percent
between FY22 and FY30, far higher than the
projected 6 to 7 percent CAGR for the offline
market (Exhibit 41).

Five supportive trends are expected to
propel this rapid growth:

 — Availability of a broader range of

medicines. While an offline pharmacy
has about 5,000 to 10,000 SKUs, an
online pharmacy offers consumers more
than 50,000 SKUs.60

 — Buyer comfort with tech platforms as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
pandemic-induced lockdown led to a
3x growth in the number of households
that buy medicines online—from around
3.5 million before COVID-19 to around
9.0 million during COVID-19.61

 — The convenience of ordering online.
Home delivery of medicines through

online orders offers great convenience,
especially for people with limited
mobility due to age or illness. Patients
with chronic disease account for a
60 to 70 percent share of the market for
chemists.62

 — Prompt delivery. Today’s online

pharmacies aim to deliver products in
four to six hours. Just a few years ago,
delivery time was three to four days.

 — Lucrative discounts. Online pharmacies
offer discounts of 15 to 20 percent, which
is double or triple what local pharmacy
shops can offer.

While the future looks promising for online
chemists, digital penetration in India (4 to
6 percent) lags behind that of global peers
such as China (8 to 10 percent) and the
United States (10 to 12 percent),63 where
advanced digitalisation levels and robust
last-mile logistics infrastructure propel
higher adoption of digital commerce.
In India, a variety of barriers currently
restrict the widespread adoption of online
medicine purchases.

Barriers to digital commerce

Potential use-cases

Pharma-
ceutical
companies
(Pharmacos)

• Pharmacos may face pricing

pressures in the future with the
consolidation of channels online,
potentially impacting profit margins.

• An open network enables the standalone chemists
to go digital and operate an omnichannel play.

• Going online enables the chemists to compete in an

omnichannel world.

• Lack of technical know-how to go
online and resistance to change
prevents distributors from exploring
the online channel at full potential.

• Technology support providers on the network (e.g.,
cataloguing, inventory management) could enable
traditional distributors to establish an online
presence with greater ease.

Distributors

Pharmacy

• High customer acquisition costs

may inflate cost structures online,
crushing the margins of the
pharmacy.

• Additional costs incurred in

digitising and managing inventory
(>5,000 SKUs in a pharmacy),
handling product returns, and
performing BTL marketing could hold
back pharmacists seeking to move
online.

• Lack of enough online demand in

Tier-3/4+ regions due to customer
preference for offline purchases.

• The evolution of eB2B could enable the distributors
to conduct business with more retailers and grow
their revenue. Margin erosion is less likely in an open
network, given that the transaction price is largely
negotiated between the distributor and the
pharmacist (e.g., pricing, discounting, etc.).

• Buyer app and seller app could pass on cost savings
achieved via synergies from the existing business
to the pharmacist, making online a profitable and
attractive proposition for them. For example, the
buyer app could monetise its existing user base to
lower customer acquisition costs. And the buyer and
seller apps could use their existing business
functions such as Finance, Human Resources, and
infrastructure such as IT, call center, etc., to realise
cost savings.

• The pharmacy can also cut procurement costs by
accessing a wider distributor network to find the
best-priced distributors and wholesalers.

• The digitalisation of the local pharmacists whom
buyers trust could boost online demand in Tier-
3/4+ regions, attracted by a wider product
assortment and better discount offers.

• Concerns around counterfeit

medicines, particularly in Tier 3/4+
towns, further deter consumers from
shopping online.

• Sellers could gain credibility on the open network as
reliable, genuine medicine providers by aggregating
seller and product ratings across buyer apps. This
could create transparency and trust.

Customers

• The lack of online access to

medicine delivery in Tier 2 and Tier
3 towns due to logistical constraints
could mean some medicines might
not be available.

• Lack of credit availability that

restricts ability to subscribe to high-
priced drugs (e.g., year-long
subscription for chronic medicines)
due to lack of credit availability.

•

Increased digitalisation of pharmacies at the local
level could allow customers to discover more
products online.

• Hyperlocal logistics could flourish with the

aggregation of demand across multiple use cases
(e.g., grocery delivery, online food delivery, etc.),
providing convenience and quick delivery.

• The availability of credit from lending institutions

based on customer’s past purchase behaviour could
allow customers to make a high-value purchase.

04

Build robust logistics and
storage capabilities

Logistics players will need to develop cold-chain-
storage capabilities, particularly in smaller regions,
to store and distribute medicines properly.

05

Offer additional support services

Buyer and seller apps need to offer customers add-
on services such as prescription verification (for
example, Optical Character Recognition technology)
and doctor teleconsultation (some customers might
require online consultation to obtain a prescription).
This could create a comprehensive, end-to-end
offering that attracts customers to online pharma.

01

Create a great customer experience

To spur greater adoption of online pharma on the
network, buyer apps must offer a user-friendly interface
with robust customer acquisition strategies. Financial
institutions could accelerate the momentum by offering
credit on high-ticket purchases (for example, a
subscription plan for chronic disease medication).

02

Tap systemic cost efficiencies

Buyer and seller apps need action-oriented cost
reduction strategies through automation (for customer
management, return handling, prescription verification,
and other actions) and cultural changes (such as
leadership-driven interventions to create lean teams that
optimise speed with quality of output). This could
enhance the unit economics for each stakeholder.

03

Digitalise the inventory

Given the vast numbers of SKUs in the industry,
pharmacists need to develop real-time online
inventory management capabilities to fulfill orders in
an optimal way. Technology service providers (e.g.,
cataloguing agencies) on the network could support
this endeavour.

Trust in the offline pharmacy going online with its
"reputation" could be a big unlock to attract
customers. ONDC could help create this reputation
through a seamless ecosystem on the open network.

85

Democratising digital commerce in India 4.6
Mobility

The jam-packed streets of India
highlight the country’s critical need
for reliable, efficient, and sustainable
mobility solutions. With a large part of
India’s population preferring flexible
and on-demand transportation, the
organised-cab and shared-mobility
segments need to be digitalised and
made more efficient. “Digital mobility”
in India—or digitalised access to
transport bookings—is a sector set to
double in size to $11 billion by 2030.1
Concentrated in the largest urban
centres at present, digital mobility
solutions could evolve into an integrated
mobility system that weaves in other
services for a smooth end-to-end rider
experience.

1  This chapter is entirely focused on digitally

accessible means of transport. The word “mobility”
is used to represent “digital mobility.”

86

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape
Digital mobility (here referred to as
“mobility”) in India appears to be on course
to more than double to as much as $11 billion
by FY30. This growth could be on the back
of rapid expansion in the two-wheeler
(2W) and three-wheeler (3W) segments,
which are expected to increase at a CAGR
of 40 to 45 percent and 20 to 25 percent
respectively through 2030 (Exhibit 42). The
top seven cities in India account for more
than 80 percent of the mobility market’s
revenues, creating a concentration in the
urban centres of the country.

India’s organised-cab and public-transport
infrastructure is constrained by several
challenges:

 — Digitalisation is still quite low, at less than

5 percent.

 — Car penetration (at less than 10 percent)
is insufficient to meet high demand for
transportation services, particularly in
areas where public-transport options are
limited.64

 — Cab drivers for aggregators are in short
supply and their income challenges
continue remain largely neglected.

87

Democratising digital commerce in India
Despite these challenges, the rise of shared
mobility services and the growth of the 2W
and 3W segments have made transportation
more affordable and accessible, particularly
for consumers unable or unwilling to buy
and maintain a personal vehicle. In the
future, demand is likely to continue growing,
especially with demographic segments
such as millennials—50 percent of whom
prefer to book well-maintained taxis online
than to own a car. The need for flexible and
on-demand transportation could spur the
growth of the organised-cab and shared-
mobility segments.

Mobility is supply constrained, with a deficit
of cab drivers. While the mobility industry
has focused on technology to improve the
customer experience, there is scope to
do more to improve the driver experience,
in addition to ongoing initiatives such
as frequent settlements, the go-home
feature that allows them to get rides in the
direction of their home, etc. A network that
empowers drivers could improve the mobility
ecosystem, and the experience for riders
and drivers.

The open network could allow for an
integrated ecosystem across sectors to
create a seamless journey experience for
users (Exhibit 43).

Improved commission structure and income
possibilities for the driver could incentivise the
shift of offline commercial cabs to digital
platforms and encourage ride completion in
far-off/less preferred locations, improving ride
availability and experience for the customer.

• ONDC could enhance the user experience by
developing a multi-modal transport network
that integrates public transport systems (e.g.,
buses and metros) into a common framework.

1 Synergies with existing functions for buyer and seller apps could reduce the need for high take-rates to maintain the same EBITDA as incumbents.
2 On average, the idle time faced by a driver is 25-35% and the gross asset utilisation is 65-70% with 10-20% spent in dead run
(arrival and wait times).

01

Create an enhanced user
interface and user experience

Buyer apps will need to enhance the current user
interface and experience (UI/UX) by developing a
single app for travellers to purchase different
mobility services and access various public
transport networks. Widespread adoption of this
app would provide an early use case for scale.

03

Ensure support for the ecosystem
from transport authorities and the
government

Public transport authorities could support
digitalisation efforts and enable integration across
modes of transport, while making sure that the
system complies with existing fare structures and
regulations. Local and state governments could
partner with unions that have state backing, thus
providing support and resources to integrate the
taxi and auto industry with the network.

02
Invest in digitalisation
efforts

04
Build a support system
for the driver

Seller apps will need to manage the onboarding of
taxis and autos onto the network, including
developing adequate technology and algorithms to
bring offline cabs into the digital fold. Doing so
would require investment in optimisation
technology and the onboarding of new partners.

A powerful way to bring more drivers on board
would be to develop a supportive ecosystem that
addresses their pain points—this could include an
improved app, financing programs for cars, health
insurance for families, education loans, and
admission support for their children.

Mobility is a continuous need and priority in a
nation of more than a billion people. Early wins
with Namma Yatri have shown the opportunity to
seamlessly digitalise the ecosystem.

Hospitality

Travel is back with renewed vigour in India
after the pandemic-induced pause on
vacations and tourism. Eagerly planning
holidays to make up for lost time, travellers
are seeking convenience, reliability, and
variety.

Thanks to a confluence of factors, India’s
hospitality sector could nearly double in
size by 2030, from $13 billion to as much
as $25 billion. Digital commerce could
be a critical driver of the sector’s growth
and represents a significant untapped
opportunity. As it scales up, ONDC could
support the emergence of a hospitality
ecosystem that offers consumers
unrivalled convenience and options and
provides hotels and homestays with
newfound discoverability.

92

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape

The hospitality sector has grown steadily
over the past few years to a current value of
$13 billion. With rapid expansion expected
in the coming decade, the market could
nearly double by FY30 with a CAGR of
about 6 percent (Exhibit 44). Growth
rates for online bookings (direct bookings
and through online travel agencies or
OTAs) are expected to outpace growth in
offline channels. This growth could stem
from multiple factors—such as the rising
disposable incomes of middle-class and

affluent consumers, improved air and road
connectivity in tier-two cities and beyond,
and the ease and attraction of domestic
travel after the shocks to international travel
from the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, digital commerce in the sector
still has room for growth—penetration in the
industry is just 25 to 30 percent in tier-one
cities and a mere 8 to 10 percent in tier-two
cities and beyond. These levels lag behind
other major economies, including the United
States (55 to 60 percent)65 and China (35 to
40 percent).66

Barriers to digital commerce

Potential use-cases

• Smaller hotels find it difficult to get on

• ONDC could bring down commission

charges due to reduced marketing and
customer acquisition costs on buyer

board; they are resistant to
digitalisation and lack sufficient
digital capabilities, such as inventory
management.

• Hotels that list on a single seller app could
sell their rooms across buyer apps, and
no longer need to maintain inventory and
price parity across platforms.

• Homestays (especially offline ones)

find it difficult to build credibility with
travelers.

• Hosts are also wary of giving their

houses to strangers and there is also
a fear of damage to property.

• Homestays and consumers could gain
credibility through a positive feedback
loop created through interoperable
ratings across seller apps and a higher
volume of transactions (due to access of
home stays to a wider market).

Customers

• The frequent mismatch between

rooms displayed at booking versus
the reality erodes trust in online
travel agents—this is the challenge of
a non-standardised inventory
(especially for home stays).

• Access to ratings and reviews on the
back of a robust and interoperable
reputation economy coupled with a high
volume of ratings could make it easier to
trust the online hospitality market.

ONDC could make it possible for consumers to find multiple solutions on the network, such
as accessing all their vacation needs in one place (Exhibit 45).

03

Establish comprehensive
onboarding rules and accurately
represent inventory

Seller apps will need to define a comprehensive set
of onboarding rules for hosts while addressing
potential safety concerns around the home-sharing
model. To reduce listing discrepancies and build
credibility among consumers, seller apps will need
to accurately represent hotel rooms and homestays
online.

01

Improve UI/UX and grievance
management

The disaggregated nature of the open network
makes grievance management and dispute
resolution more complex. Buyer apps will need a
user interface and grievance management process
at par with those of current OTA leaders to execute
this use case. Third-party service providers could
also build solutions using augmented and virtual
reality to allow potential guests to preview
properties in detail before booking, providing an
enhanced level of transparency and confidence in
their decision making.

02
Ensure fair visibility for all hotels
and homestays

Buyer apps can create ranking algorithms for
impartial visibility to all accommodation options
based on customer preferences. Network
participants can have transparency on how
rankings work.

These important details can make or break a
vacation for customers, and attending to them could
create a virtuous cycle of business in the hospitality
ecosystem. The digital advantage could enable a
transformed experience for all network participants
and rapidly unlock growth for the sector.

$550 billion to $600 billion.1 Central to the
sector are vast numbers of SME contractors
that remain underserved by a highly
fragmented market by number of players;
India currently has 300,000 construction
SMEs, and the ten largest players control
about 70 percent of the market.2 Additionally,
the limited number of at-scale players has
created white space for SMEs to expand their
operations. For these reasons, ONDC has the
potential to unlock significant value for SMEs
in the construction market.

Key challenges in the current
ecosystem
The residential construction value chain
comprises four key stakeholder groups—
customers, architects, contractors, and
manufacturers—each of whom faces a
unique set of barriers to widespread digital
adoption.

Customers struggle to find reliable
builders and contractors due to their lack
of trust in the quality and price of materials
procured and the quality of work delivered
by contractors. They must manage a
multitude of stakeholders in the process and
experience frequent project delays that lead
to higher total costs.

Architects face challenges in growing their
businesses due to limited discoverability
(mostly word of mouth) and difficulty in
establishing trust and credibility to potential
customers.

Contractors serve as the linchpin in the
current ecosystem. However, their margins
are highly sensitive to procurement prices
(saving about 2 percent leads to an increase
in margins of 18 to 20 percent), and they
frequently struggle to secure formal loans
and credit, which can increase financing
costs. Like architects, the growth of
their business is often impeded by low
discoverability (word of mouth) and the
difficulty of gaining trust from prospective
customers. In addition, they have limited
ability to engage with and cross-sell to
customers who have needs across product
categories (such as tiles and sanitary
ware). Finally, a lack of coordination among
different stakeholders frequently leads to
project delays.

How ONDC can unlock value for
the sector
Four use cases illustrate how ONDC can
address many existing pain points to drive
digital adoption and boost the construction
materials industry.

1. Sourcing: Discovery for online

procurement

ONDC could also enable a large number
of MSME manufacturers in this space to
connect directly with buyers (Exhibit 46).
Buyer apps could access key building
materials and products across multiple
brands through various seller apps. SKUs
across a wide range of product categories
could be catalogued in a standardised
way, and contractors could achieve lower
sourcing costs through demand aggregation
that enables multiple product purchases
from a single touchpoint.

2. Financing: Easy access to credit and

loans

Contractors could qualify for financing
at better-than-industry rates through
partnerships with non-banking financial
companies (NBFCs) and fintech players,
which would benefit from a large, untapped
customer base. Through ONDC, contractors
could take advantage of innovative
underwriting (for example, through
milestone-based funding and improved
transaction visibility). In addition, they can
access companies that offer bill discounting,
purchase order financing, and asset
financing, which could fill working capital
gaps and in turn could help them scale their
businesses.

3. Logistics: Unbundling to improve
distribution

Stakeholders across the value chain could
take advantage of unbundled logistics on
the network to improve the distribution and
last-mile delivery for SMEs. For example,
they could enhance supply chain efficiency
by using logistics players to aggregate and
service demand from multiple sources.
Similarly, contractors could achieve better
inventory management through expanded
logistics networks to enable the shift from
bulk to frequent purchasing. Such services
could enable contractors to access a
wider pool of customers and expand their
operations beyond local and regional plays.

4. Labour: Discovery of self-employed

workers

Today, the self-employed economy
is characterised by high levels of
fragmentation, low discoverability (driven
by word of mouth), and low digitalisation. An
online ecosystem could enable connections
and discoverability among prospective
customers, architects, contractors, and
self-employed workers. To support this
ecosystem, ONDC could facilitate third-
party integration with a seller app that
includes labour matching algorithms. And

by providing certification and ratings across
a federated network, ONDC could support
broader discovery and increase the number
of meaningful leads for professionals.

Potential impact on a typical
contractor
As a result of these use cases, ONDC has the
potential to reduce an SME’s cost to serve
by 5 to 10 percent (see Exhibit 47 for an
illustrative example).

Challenges and considerations for
successful adoption
ONDC and network participants will need
to overcome specific challenges to drive
adoption of high-priority use cases and
unlock the full potential of ONDC in India’s
construction materials industry.

1. Sourcing: Discovery for online

procurement

Today, some 60 to 70 percent of business
on potential seller apps is conducted
through offline channels. More than
90 percent of MSMEs lack the robust IT
systems and productivity tools they need
for digital commerce. Furthermore, many
B2B buyers are looking for high-ticket

items with customised pricing and product
specifications, which can result in quality
assurance issues when products are
procured through digital channels.

ONDC and network participants can
alleviate these concerns in several ways.
Buyer apps can redirect their people and
resources from offline to online customer
acquisition, for example, by providing
online purchase incentives. Seller apps
can help MSMEs digitise their inventory by
offering cataloguing services. Meanwhile,
technology service providers on the
network can improve quality assurance—for
example, by implementing a pan-network
scoring and badging system.

101

Democratising digital commerce in India 2. Credit: Easy access to credit and loans

3. Labour: Discovery of self-employed

Financial institutions face a cold-start
problem in providing formal access to credit.
A majority of MSMEs still conduct their sales
offline, so they have limited operational
data to secure credit. Workarounds such
as collateral-free lending could be difficult
to scale due to collection issues, especially
for underserved MSME-to-MSME sales
channels.

To address these challenges, ONDC can
onboard third-party fintech companies
that can provide credit based on alternative
data sources—for example, execution-
based funding, analysis of utility bills, and
social media. Network participants can also
digitalise credit processes (such as e-know
your customer and e-signatures) to widen
MSME adoption.

workers

Two forces currently limit the broader use of
self-employed in the construction industry.
First, customers find it difficult to trust
prospective workers because there is no
way to verify their professional qualifications
and capabilities. Second, the current
industry is highly relationship-driven, with
exclusive networks of contractors.

Several actions can help build trust among
self-employed workers and customers.
Buyer apps, which may struggle to generate
demand, can partner with large builders
and contractors in need of such workers
to scale adoption. Seller apps can build
platforms to enable accurate search with
verification of qualifications and capabilities
of professionals. ONDC can provide
certification and ratings systems on a
federated network to help workers establish
their credibility with prospective customers.

MSMEs (Micro, small and medium enterprises) are the backbone of the country with
90-100 million businesses empowering the nation. ONDC will democratise the access
across the buyers and sellers, through an Internet like “Network”. Not only this will
create a level playing field for MSMEs in ecommerce, but it will be yet another star in
India’s public digital infrastructure sky.

Agriculture

India has a large and growing agricultural
sector. The second-largest agriculture
producer in the world after China, India
is the world’s largest producer of milk,
mangoes, bananas, papayas, and pulses.1
In fiscal year 2022, the sector had a total
market size (across inputs and outputs)
of about $500 billion. Agricultural outputs
(predominantly crops and livestock) account
for more than 90 percent of the total market,
while agricultural inputs (including fertilisers,
agro-chemicals, seeds, and other farm
mechanisation inputs) make up the rest.2

Key challenges across the
value chain
Despite the industry’s size, value chains
are highly fragmented and inefficient, with
minimal digital penetration. Value chain
structures and stakeholder margins vary
significantly among crops and types of
produce across both input and output value
chains, reflecting a lack of standardisation
across the sector (Exhibit 48). Moreover,
the large number of intermediaries—
aggregators, distributors, mandis, agents,
and retailers—adds to inefficiencies and
reduces productivity for farmers, a cost that
often gets passed on to consumers in the
form of higher prices.

Confronted with these challenges, India’s
vast population of farmers experiences
pain points and barriers to digital adoption
across every stage of the farming cycle—
from financing and risk mitigation to sowing
and planting, harvesting, and selling their
products. All these barriers are exacerbated
and underpinned by a scarcity of trust
among farmers and a highly localised
environment that impedes digital adoption
at scale.

information, commodities, and inputs that
they need to optimise production. Many do
not have critical information about weather
forecasts or knowledge of which tools
or fertilisers to use. Access to essential
commodities and equipment, such as
hybrid seeds and tractors for rent, remains
limited. Meanwhile, long and complex
legal processes impede the expansion of
agricultural input retail outlets (for example,
it can take dozens of permissions to set up
an organised rural retail outlet). Farmers
continue to rely on physical demonstrations
and touch-and-feel assurance when
purchasing inputs, which creates an
additional barrier to digital adoption.

Harvesting

Even though India is one of the largest
agricultural producers in the world, its farm
mechanisation rate is below 40 percent—
well short of the United States (95 percent),
Brazil (75 percent), and China (57 percent).68
The lack of cold-chain logistics and facilities
also creates inefficiencies in the supply
chain: up to 40 percent of farm produce
is wasted before food ever reaches the
customer.69

Financing and risk mitigation

Selling

Without access to formal credit, many of
India’s farmers rely on informal loans from
local money lenders or retailers, with interest
rates that can be up to ten percentage
points higher than those associated with
formal credit.67 The lack of transparency and
effective collection mechanisms makes it
difficult for banks to expand formal credit
through digital channels. Long gestation
periods exacerbate the cost of credit, as
farmers must wait until after harvest to pay
back the loans that they took out before
planting. Furthermore, many Indian farmers
do not have any type of crop insurance,
making them particularly vulnerable to bad
harvests and unforeseen weather events.

Planning, planting, and in-season care

Farmers often have limited access to the

When it comes to selling their products,
farmers struggle with low price visibility,
low margins, and low bargaining power in
hyperlocal markets. They often lack accurate
and up-to-date information on prices in
other markets. Most produce is sold through
multiple parties and intermediaries, which
means farmers may earn significantly less
than the retail price of their crops. As a
result of geographic restrictions, farmers
often have no choice but to sell at their local
mandi, which in turn further diminishes their
bargaining power. Moreover, the lack of
an effective quality assurance mechanism
and complex legal frameworks that vary
across states and districts make it difficult to
digitalise the transport and sale of goods.

How ONDC can unlock value for
the sector
While existing platforms have made progress
toward alleviating these pain points, they
have not yet built the scale to provide an
end-to-end digital offering for farmers
and customers. To enable value creation,
interventions must address farmers’
pain points and allow them to improve
productivity. This would create economic
surplus that can then be distributed across
the value chain. By cutting across current
platform archetypes, ONDC has the
potential to enable solutions to many of
these challenges at scale and transform the
value chain across the entire industry.

Four use cases illustrate how ONDC can
accelerate digital adoption and unlock value
across India’s agricultural sector:

1. Accelerate direct-to-farmer commerce

ONDC could enable direct linkages between
farmers and other stakeholders across
both agricultural input and output value
chains. On the input side, farmers could
purchase directly from manufacturers—
potentially resulting in higher margins for
manufacturers and enabling farmers to make
more informed product choices, which could
lead to improved yields and better on-field
outcomes. On the output side, farmers could
sell directly to large businesses, retailers,
and individual consumers—which would
minimise wastage, reduce touchpoints in
the value chain, and improve farmer profits.
ONDC could also bring together multiple
platforms that operate in niche areas,
widening the farmer base and the potential
market for sellers. By digitalising the
certification and licensing process, ONDC
could make it easier for retailers to secure
authorisation and tap into the open network.

2. Improve transparency, traceability, and

efficiency

By increasing the transparency and reach
of the market, ONDC could enable better
price discovery, more efficient logistics, and

a higher degree of traceability across the
value chain:

 — Price discovery. The open market could
allow farmers to gain price visibility
across multiple seller apps and choose
the most affordable inputs. Similarly,
consumers and retailers could gain price
transparency among sellers without
solely relying on mandi pricing.

 — Logistics efficiencies. ONDC could

create efficiencies and prevent waste by
facilitating the discovery of cold-chain
infrastructure and on-demand logistics
providers. Sellers could extend their
geographic reach by accessing a wider
range of distribution partners and options
for hyperlocal delivery in underserved
markets.

 — Traceability. The open network could

improve product traceability by enabling
end-to-end tracking of produce from
farms in the case of exports.

3. Accelerate better access to formal credit

ONDC could help bridge the formal credit
gap by improving farmers’ access to credit,
innovating new financing structures, and
digitalising credit functions. Through the
open network, farmers could discover
multiple formal credit sources from both
banks and NBFCs with fewer geographic
constraints, instead of relying on retailers for
informal credit. ONDC could spur innovative
financing structures—including operations-
based funding, credit issued against
transaction history on the network, and
credit based on nonconventional markers
(such as PM Kisan credit, subsidy flows,
and crop insurance debit). Integrations with
existing solutions (such as Agristack) can
also leverage farmer data to inform credit
decisioning. Moreover, ONDC could help
digitalise and simplify the credit journey
for customers by eliminating the need
for bank branch visits and streamlining
documentation requirements.

4. Improve on-farm efficiency

Bringing farmers into the digital commerce
marketplace could increase their access
to better advisory and forecasting tools.
With more access to information and more
opportunities to connect with market
players (such as agtech start-ups), farmers
could access personalised crop advice
and incorporate the latest tools and
techniques to increase yields, reduce input
costs, boost productivity, and improve
sustainability. Through the ONDC network,
farmers could also gain access to better
demand forecasting, weather forecasting,
and pest attack forecasting. With these,
farmers would be able to optimise their input
requirements; improve the timing of their
irrigation, fertiliser, and pesticide purchases;
and minimise the loss of crops due to pest
attacks.

Potential impact on a typical
farmer
As a result of the four use cases described
above, ONDC could increase a farmer’s net
income by 25 to 35 percent (see Exhibit 49
for an illustrative example). This additional
revenue is derived from four distinct levers—
cost reductions, improved productivity, price
realisation, and other services.

Challenges and considerations for
successful adoption
ONDC and network participants will
need to address user behaviour and
ecosystem challenges to drive adoption and
transform India’s agricultural sector. The
critical challenges and considerations to
successfully implement each of the four use
cases are as follows:

Democratising digital commerce in India

1. Accelerate direct-to-farmer commerce

3. Provide access to formal credit

ONDC participants will need to overcome
low digital adoption among farmers and
build trust in the digital ecosystem. Existing
informal networks have a low cost of doing
business; digitalising direct linkages may
prove to be expensive. Furthermore, ONDC
may face pushback from stakeholders within
the existing value chain.

To overcome these challenges, buyer and
seller apps will need to invest in education
and incentives for digital adoption. Seller
apps can partner with farmer producer
organisations (FPOs) to onboard farmers to
the network, while buyer apps can onboard
modern retailers and consumers who are
willing to purchase directly. Third parties can
set benchmarks and standardise parameters
for quality assurance. Meanwhile,
government intervention can help streamline
statewide licensing processes and enable
pan-India transactions through the network.

2. Improve transparency, traceability, and

efficiency across the value chain

Today, buyers and sellers face limited
options and low discoverability for key
infrastructure (such as cold-chain logistics).
Additionally, most inputs are purchased on
demand in response to an immediate need,
and farmers may be unwilling to wait multiple
days for delivery, even if it is more cost
effective.

Local players can help fill in the gaps by
setting up hyperlocal logistics networks,
while seller apps and third parties can
provide services that enable the end-to-end
tracking of produce across the value chain.
Additionally, the integration of advisory
services with ONDC can help farmers
optimise their planning and smooth demand
for inputs.

Many farmers rely on informal lending
channels that have been built through
relationships and trust. In the shift from
informal to formal credit, underwriting
challenges may persist as farmers find it
difficult to access and establish their credit
history. The lack of collections facilities and
infrastructure makes it more difficult for
financial institutions to expand formal credit
access.

Buyer and seller apps both have a role to
play. Buyer apps can invest in embedded
financing for inputs and educate farmers on
the adoption of formal credit. Seller apps
can invest in the human resources and
capabilities to enable collections.

4. Improve on-farm efficiency

While new tools and techniques can help
farmers improve efficiency, farmers will
need some initial support and examples to
understand why and how to change their
farming practices. Personalised advisory
services are difficult to scale (as they
require access to data including location
and agro-climatic conditions) and difficult
to monetise (because most of the economic
value is indirectly generated through inputs
and outputs sold on the back of advisory).
Additionally, best-in-class research is
currently neither digitalised nor centralised.

The government can take the lead on
digitalising the latest precision farming
research and providing access to all
stakeholders. Advisory service providers
can engage in partnerships (for example,
with input players on the network) to cross-
sell and monetise their services. Finally,
platforms can contribute by developing
local language interfaces and feet-on-street
tactics to boost adoption among farmers.

Financial
services

The face of financial services in India has
transformed. In a paradigm shift from
queuing at the bank branch and counting
out cash at points of sale, Indians today are
banking with ease without leaving home and
scanning to pay their way through their daily
transactions—notching up the highest digital
payment volumes globally. ONDC could take
financial services deeper into the ecosystem,
delivering credit and insurance to the
stakeholders who sorely need it, powering
seller growth and boosting investments. The
open network could connect more than a
billion consumers seeking financial services
and 100 million MSMEs and self-employed
skilled workers eager to scale up their
operations, customer base, and offerings.

110

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape
Continuously evolving, the financial-
services sector is reaching unprecedented
scale (Exhibit 50). The map of India is dotted
with a vast network of more than 150,000
bank branches representing more than 130
banks, and around 8,000 NBFCs. While just
over a third of Indians had bank accounts in
2011, around 80 percent of the population
is banked today. In just three years, the
number of demat account holders has
tripled to 100 million. Insurance premiums
have reached an all-time high of $115 billion,
and 40 asset management firms support
India’s investors in managing their portfolios.

India is also home to around 2,000 fintech
companies that are constantly innovating
to cater to the dynamic needs of a modern
India.70

In recent years, two major transformations
have changed the financial-services
landscape in India. First, the push to open
bank accounts for every single Indian
through the Jan-Dhan Yojana has boosted
account penetration like never before. In
just a decade, India’s account penetration
rose from around 35 percent in 2011 to about
80 percent in 2021 (Exhibit 51).71

Second, India has established itself as
a prominent global player in financial
services. The launch of digital payment
infrastructure (DPI) such as Aadhaar, e-KYC,
and Unified Payments Interface (UPI),
along with extensive efforts by public and
private institutions, has greatly increased
access to banking services. Today, India
boasts the world’s highest volume of digital
real-time payments. There is an S-curve of
rapidly growing adoption as a critical mass
of users scale up, spurred by a shift from
physical banking (characterised by customer
walk-ins and face-to-face interactions)
to digital channels (branchless banking
made possible by modern, contactless
technologies).

Room for greater growth
While this rapid evolution is heartening and
transformative, scope remains for greater
growth across major financial products.

Credit lending

A glaring lending gap dominates in both
the retail lending and MSME segments
in India (Exhibit 52). Household debt is a
mere 14 percent of GDP, compared with
a global average of about 60 percent.
Of India’s roughly 400 million to 440 million
eligible retail-lending customers, only 25 to
30 percent have received credit from formal
lenders. The remaining 70 to 75 percent face
a range of challenges:

112

Democratising digital commerce in India

 — Patchy or insufficient documentation
makes it difficult to comply with the
“know your customer” (KYC) norms
that stand between the applicant and
the loan.

 — Around 60 to 65 percent of customers
are not part of the credit bureau, so
there is a dearth of reporting on their
creditworthiness.72 As a result, such loan
seekers turn to high-interest informal
loans instead of formal credit.

 — While innovative lending products exist,
they are not easily discoverable online.
Their value proposition helps no one if
there is no uptake.

 — Credit options at the point of sale are
available only through select digital
channels for a small subset of retail
consumers.

Like retail borrowers, small-business owners
face a host of issues when seeking loans:

 — They may be unable to furnish audited
financial statements and have limited
banking history or statements that
can help the credit issuers to make an
informed decision.

 — They have limited documented collateral
to provide in support of their application.

 — The lengthy application process requires
multiple bank visits, taking away from
their productive working hours.

 — The repayment cycle of 30 days is not
in sync with the cash flow pattern of
receipts coming in every 45 days.

These challenges have led to an MSME
lending gap of $300 billion. At least
60 percent of India’s 100 million MSMEs
(including kiranas) are unable to access
formal credit because of the barriers to
financing.73

Insurance products

Digital penetration in India’s insurance
industry is low, at less than 5 percent of
the population; by comparison, digital

penetration in the United States is
14 percent. Even in non-life categories,
the digital share is 5 to 6 percent in India
and 19 percent in the United Kingdom.74
This is due to various factors. For example,
awareness of benefits is low, and complex
products are insufficiently explained online,
which deters potential buyers who might be
looking to understand a product.

Traditional products exist, but there is a need
to innovate to offer more tailored insurance
products—for example, health policies that
cover preexisting diseases common among
Indians, such as heart disease. And finally,
the insurance purchase and claim filing
process is not standardised.

Mutual funds and investment products

Indian consumers have raced to put their
funds in investment products in the past
six years—and assets under management
(AUM) across fintech players have grown
10x to $5 billion. During this period, the
emergence of discount brokerage players
has promoted a 4x increase in the number
of demat accounts—from around 25 million
in 2016 to more than 100 million in August
2022. Digital platforms now account for 8 to
10 percent of AUM across direct and indirect
channels in India.75 This leaves scope for
greater growth, especially compared to
other economies where digital platforms
manage higher percent of AUM.

Several challenges restrict digital
penetration. Consumers have limited
awareness and financial literacy about
investment products, online platforms,
and regulations. They are in the habit of
building trust through in-person interactions
with investment counsellors, and online
transactions raise lingering fears of
malpractice or fraud.

Overcoming these challenges for deeper
digital adoption across financial products
is crucial for a more robust and flourishing
financial-services ecosystem.

The role of ONDC in accelerating
digital adoption
India’s digital economy has seen several
inflection points over the past few years
(Exhibit 53). Aadhaar enrolments grew from
600 million in 2014 to 1.3 billion in 2022, the
percentage of Indians age 15 and older with
a bank account more than doubled, and
digital transactions grew sevenfold over the
past five years.

In addition to these developments, India’s
comprehensive digital public infrastructure
forms a strong backbone for financial
services to grow exponentially, with the
rollout of DPIs, e.g., account aggregators
(AAs) at scale. Add to this the ONDC

muscle that is poised to eliminate barriers
to digital commerce for stakeholders, and
financial services could be at an inflection
point in India (Exhibit 54). The network
could connect financial institutions with
more than one billion consumers and
90-100 million MSMEs, benefitting them all
in the following ways:

Meeting credit needs of MSMEs

With the expansive open data on the
network, financial institutions could more
smoothly extend credit to underserved small
businesses and that could drive significant
growth in MSME lending (Exhibit 55).

on open credit enabled networks

Formal credit will provide access to multiple lenders
with competitive product pricing

Granular products tailored to needs and
preferences of MSMEs, e.g., invoice financing, short

Focus on core capability around superior product
building and buyer app to focus on UI and customer
experience

The integration of ONDC with multiple
platforms—such as Government
e-Marketplace (GeM), Sahay, Trade
Receivables Discount System (TreDS),
and Receivables Exchange of India Ltd
(RXIL)—could enable the relevant data
flow to process supply chain and invoicing
finance loans (Exhibit 56). Underlying this
is a complex, enabling layer from ONDC
that integrates data from the Income Tax
Department, GST, Credit Bureau, and
Supplier Banking Data from AA, along with
ONDC’s supplier scores.

MSMEs could get unsecured business
loans to support their expansion plans (for
example, for a restaurant owner to upgrade
operations) as well as working-capital lines.
Suppliers could benefit from embedded
insurance products to safeguard their
goods during shipping and export. Financial
institutions might also provide MSMEs with
other value-added services such as tax
filing, advisory services, personal financing,
and legal counsel—on their own or through
ONDC network partners.

An attractive customer value proposition

With ONDC, buyer apps could offer an array
of financial services, from travel insurance
to payment financing options (Exhibit 57).
Ease of use, faster access to credit, and a
memorable customer experience could grow
consumer financing significantly from its
current market size ($3 billion).

Buyers making online purchases could
receive financing options at checkout as a
payment option, along with an explanation
of benefits and terms. If they express
willingness, they could also see customised
offers (based on the buyer profile) for credit
and insurance products, giving them greater
choice across multiple lenders, rates,
and discounts. They also would enjoy an
attractive user interface and high-quality
customer service.

Seller apps (in this case, financial-services
providers) could focus on improved products
and underwriting processes to extend credit
and insurance products to a broader set of
consumers.

A dynamic, expanding suite of financial-
services products

ONDC envisions an open, inclusive, and
competitive marketplace that could provide
new opportunities for banks and financial
institutions to connect with customers.
NBFCs and niche fintechs (such as monoline
lenders that focus on a specific type of
credit) could tailor their offerings to targeted
use cases using the open network data.

An NBFC or fintech company, for example,
could partner with fintech companies on the
network to expand its offerings (Exhibit 58).
It could choose to collaborate with a
personal finance manager to stretch to a
fuller suite of financial services offerings for
a wider customer base.

In these ways, an open network such as
ONDC could create multiple use cases that
promote digital commerce and embed it in
financial services.

01
Stitch together digital public goods such as AA
and UPI with ONDC for a seamless commerce,
payment, and lending experience

New seller apps could emerge to cater to previously
unserved MSMEs—unlocking their access to secure
funds at lower rates than they would get from
unorganised providers. Financial institutions could
tailor offerings to MSMEs—for example, with granular,
lower-ticket products that fit with their repayment
cycles and working-capital needs. Various
participants in the ecosystem could also enable the
seamless disbursal of credit. Personal financial
services for MSMEs could ensure financial fitness,
embed insurance across the supply chain (for
example, covering products that could be damaged in
transit), and ensure that businesses have the goods
to support day-to-day functioning.

Issuing credit to those who are deserving but
underserved could become smoother as ONDC
scales up. Its buyer apps could bring more than a
billion potential consumers to the marketplace,
while its seller apps could bring nearly 100 million
small businesses and more than 500 lenders. The
integration of protocols for a digital lending
gateway and AAs (to provide data to lenders for
underwriting) with ONDC could mean a new unlock
for MSME credit (Exhibit 59).

As an illustration, a supplier app loan service
provider (LSP) signals a nudge to a credit-seeking
MSME and brings it on board. With the MSME’s
consent, the lender accesses an account
aggregator to receive consolidated financial
information. Armed with this information, the lender
offers a loan, in parallel with offerings from other
lenders. The supplier then selects the offer,
completes the KYC, and provides disbursal account
details, setting up repayment through E-NACH or E-
Mandate. After the agreement is signed, the MSME
allows monitoring, and the loan is disbursed.

In this way, both the borrower and lender have
made an informed choice to borrow or to lend,
creating inclusion and empowerment in a free-
flowing, transformed lending landscape for both
consumers and MSMEs.

Improve underwriting through
availability of alternative data
sources enabled by ONDC

Access to open data would make it possible to assign
scores to financial services. The financer could
access MSME data across sources for better
underwriting, whether for invoice financing, a
working-capital loan, or capital financing
(Exhibit 60).

03

Modernise core technologies
across banks, especially public-
sector banks

Traditional banks in India would need to step up their
IT infrastructure to truly tap into the potential of
ONDC. Investing to modernise their core technology
will be critical, for example to build the capability to
ensure 24/7 loan disbursals and servicing.

04
Engage and enable ecosystem
players (TSPs, fintechs) to
accelerate the digitalisation of
financial-services journeys

Technology service providers and fintechs could
facilitate the digitalisation of financial-services
journeys in ONDC for a seamless customer
experience. This could include providing services
such as virtual KYC, fraud checks, NACH (National
Automated Clearing House) mandates, and more.

05

Drive supportive product
policies and mindset changes
across financial-services and
ecosystem partners

The enactment of supportive credit policies to
enable machine-led underwriting could eliminate
the need for certain manual and cumbersome
processes, such as validating customer profiles.
The adoption of ONDC would represent a huge
shift from traditional ways of working. Therefore,
financial institutions and other ecosystem partners
would need to pursue change management efforts
within the organisation to instill the appropriate
mindset and culture.

06
Streamline and evaluate
KYC norms
Simplification of existing KYC norms and
guidelines for full digital lending—that is,
existing KYC norms and limits—need
reevaluation to enable full STP digital
lending journey especially for MSME
segment.

Ensuring these enablers are in place could help to
unleash the full potential of ONDC to transform
the financial-services landscape in India. Doing so
could bring financial inclusion and prosperity to a
huge segment of India’s population, accelerating
the country’s economic and social development.

Logistics

Providing a livelihood for 22 million Indians,
logistics is a critical contributor to the
economy, worth $190 billion to $200 billion.
Pushed up by infrastructure limitations,
logistics costs in India are higher than
several other economies. For example, the
average logistics cost by GDP is 11 percent
among BRICS countries, while in India it
is 14 percent.1 With only 2 percent of the
industry digitalised, an open network such
as ONDC could make a difference to logistics
costs in India.

Democratising digital commerce in India

The landscape
India’s logistics sector, while a critical
contributor to the economy, is constrained
by infrastructural challenges such as
inadequate road and rail connectivity,
complex customs, limited visibility across
demand and supply, and subscale fleet
opportunities.

Logistics providers for ecommerce
companies struggle with significant gaps
– they are not able to aggregate or batch
delivery services as they are either captive
providers (captive logistics accounts
for about 55 to 60 percent) or are third-
party logistics providers (3PLs) whose
arrangement with their client curtails them

from aggregating deliveries.

While digital interventions could minimise
such challenges and slash costs, the
industry is only at around 2 percent
digitalisation. It lacks the technology
infrastructure to benefit all stakeholders.
For example, one major gap is a common
technology infrastructure for GPS data
exchange to seamlessly integrate across
different systems, regardless of the
device used. This section focuses on
road transportation in logistics—a large
subsector ($115 billion to $120 billion), highly
fragmented and lacking price discoverability
(Exhibit 61).

in untapped markets including rural or
underserved areas and bring in more
self-employed workers, unlocking India’s
informal economy.

 — Improved price visibility and

Barriers to digital adoption
Stakeholders across the road transport
value chain are hesitant to adopt digital
solutions for several reasons:

 — Shippers tend to place greater trust in

local, familiar connections than in online
channels. They develop these networks
over decades of steady business
relationships, creating a strong sense
of loyalty and reluctance to switch away
from existing partners. Consequently,
many shippers hesitate to switch to
digital platforms and work with new fleet
operators.

 — Brokers and 3PL contractors could
be wary of digital platforms trying to
disrupt the current ecosystem. These
players work in an arbitrage-based
business model, and the entry of a digital
commerce platform could negatively
impact their margins.

 — Fleet owners and truck drivers generally
have limited digital literacy and are often
unfamiliar with the digital platforms’
processes. This leads to a mistrust of
digital marketplaces, and they typically
prefer to interact with shippers in person,
such as during post-service follow-ups.

How ONDC can unlock value
ONDC could potentially help logistics
stakeholders unlock five use cases:

 — A higher scale of operations bringing
down logistics costs. ONDC could
spur growth in the e-commerce sector,
boosting last- and first-mile delivery
volumes. This would enable logistics
players to benefit from economies of
scale, ultimately reducing costs. It could
also create opportunities for new players

transparency across the value chain.
The free flow of information, especially
price, is crucial for a well-functioning
market. ONDC could help facilitate this by
improving price visibility and discovery
for shippers as well as fleet operators,
empowering them to make informed
decisions. It could also improve visibility
of location, asset use, and loading status
for trucks, which in turn could reduce
downtime, improve asset utilisation,
and provide better financing options to
fleets. Finally, ONDC can help improve
trust within the system via a robust rating
mechanism and a high volume of ratings.

 — Improved demand aggregation. ONDC
can help identify logistics demand,
enabling delivery personnel to work
across sectors and increasing their
earning potential. For instance, during a
temporary slump in food orders, delivery
personnel could assist in fulfilling last-
mile and e-commerce deliveries. This
flexibility could improve operational
efficiency and reduce costs for delivery
personnel while also ensuring timely
delivery for customers. ONDC could also
enable the batching of delivery orders
across multiple sellers, leading to cost
reductions (Exhibit 62).

 — Backward integration of logistics apps
to become retail seller apps. ONDC
creates avenues for value-added-service
(VAS) players to expand their services.
VAS players could use their shipper
databases to create a seller app in the
open network that offers services to a
broader customer base—for example,
a player could integrate backward to
become a seller app. By doing so, these
players differentiate themselves in the
market and boost their revenue streams.

 — Digitalisation of transaction history.
This could benefit players across the
road transport value chain, e.g., digital
proof of delivery could shorten payment
cycles, ensuring faster and more efficient
payment processes. In addition, access
to transaction history could enable
companies to develop innovative
credit mechanisms, such as the digital
disbursement of bank-backed trip loans.
These could facilitate working-capital
financing for express players, less-than-
container-load (LCL) consolidators, and
freight forwarders. SMEs could also
benefit from these processes by gaining
easy access to credit for logistics.

Over time, it could become simpler to
embed insurance and credit in buyer
apps (Exhibit 63), thus streamlining
the purchasing process and increasing

protection against road accidents. The free
flow of information across ONDC could
also allow insurers to factor additional data
such as truck ratings into their models for
accurate and efficient pricing.

ONDC has the potential to unlock additional
value and business-building opportunities
for road transport players. The open network
could facilitate seamless, multimodal
deliveries through several logistics
providers, offering buyers a wider range
of delivery options. For example, logistics
buyers can now access and leverage
multiple modes of transport—such as full-
truck-load (FTL) and railways—for each leg
of the journey, via the same network, leading
to easier coordination, lower overheads, and
maximum efficiency (Exhibit 64).

Ensure a robust supply network

As ONDC facilitates greater digital adoption, the
demand for first- and last-mile delivery services
could increase significantly. To be able to scale

Although ONDC can enhance price visibility and
transparency in the market, buyers need to still be
able to shortlist logistics providers based on
performance and scale to make informed choices.
ONDC could establish a robust reputation economy
by partnering with third-party providers to
showcase unbiased and accurate ratings of
logistics players.

03

Upskill delivery personnel to
handle different goods

Even with ONDC allowing demand aggregation and
better use of delivery personnel, logistics players
must take responsibility for ensuring their delivery
personnel are properly trained to handle a variety of
goods and services seamlessly. This means
implementing effective training methodologies and
processes to ensure that all delivery personnel can
meet the standards required to maintain quality and
reliability across the logistics value chain.

04
Set up technology infrastructure
to implement digitised proof of
delivery

While digitalised proof of delivery (PoD) has
the potential to significantly shorten payment
cycles by reducing paperwork, its effective
implementation requires appropriate tech
infrastructure investment by shippers and logistics
players. Furthermore, seamless transactions
depend on widespread acceptance of digital PoDs
among truck drivers, fleet owners, and shippers
without disputes or delays.

With digitalisation unlocking utilisation,
visibility, and efficiency across the logistics
value chain, ONDC could help India to bring
down its higher-than-average logistics costs,
benefitting all stakeholders.

Scope for all players to benefit from an open network

Each sector has a set of considerations to drive digital commerce, with the onus resting on specific
stakeholders. However, the opportunity does not end with them. The unbundling of discrete services on the
open network could create infinite opportunities for incumbent companies and new entrants to carve out
niches for themselves.

ONDC could provide additional opportunities for both incumbents and new
entrants to participate.

Leading consumer tech companies
(e.g., fintech, telecom orgs.)
 Diversify and enhance business offering to

adjacent categories (e.g., grocery, mobility) as a
buyer app

 Achieve profitable unit economics by driving cost

synergies with existing capabilities (e.g., in
manpower)

 Boost consumer engagement on their platform,

driving cross-sell and upsell

Sellers
 Access host of services from tech providers
(e.g., tax and inventory management) and
brands (e.g., incentives, marketing support
etc.) to go and run business online with ease
 Achieve improved unit economics owing to
less platform commission and potential
reduction in delivery charges (e.g., by building
low-cost capability to cater to a concentrated
demand in the neighborhood)

Logistics players
 Create an additional revenue stream by investing

ahead of the demand in hyperlocal logistics

 Achieve cost efficiencies to increase profitability
due to more and concentrated hyperlocal demand
 Access rich data to improve the demand-supply

matching engine and further reduce costs

SaaS players
 Expand their business by designing low-cost and
scalable tech solutions for sellers (e.g., scoring,
CRM, tax management, pricing, cataloguing, tech
support) and seller apps (e.g., chatbots,
cataloguing)

Brands/OEMs
 Niche/ new brands could boost their D2C play by
registering as a seller or seller app on the network

 Harness consumer data on purchase behavior
across buyer apps to inform future strategies

1 General trade stores e.g., kiranas in grocery, pharmacists in pharma, etc.

POS players


Leverage current business strength i.e.,
partnership with GT1, restaurants etc. to
become a seller app on the network

 Create additional revenue stream at a low

cost by digitising sellers

Resellers and influencers
 Build/ expand their online business by

leveraging varied support available on the
network (e.g., pricing and certification agencies
could collaborate with electronics resellers,
fashion influencers could partner with brands)

Banks and NBFCs
 Grow portfolio by underwriting
MSMEs based on data available
with buyer and seller apps

ONDC for
the world

lthough ONDC is being tested
in India, the problems it seeks
to solve are global in nature.
Even in developed countries,

A

internet access alone does not necessarily
translate to the widespread adoption of
digital commerce across all sectors. Despite
the rise in internet connectivity around
the world, cross-border trade and digital
commerce remain out of reach for many
companies, especially small sellers, and for
billions of consumers.

As the network grows, it could influence
digital commerce on a global scale in two
primary ways: by promoting cross-border
trade and by accelerating and democratising
digital commerce across markets. For ONDC
to transform digital commerce beyond the
borders of India, four key enablers must be
in place—seamless cross-border payment
settlements, stringent grievance redressal
systems, a globalised taxonomy, and a global
coalition to support digital commerce.

135

Democratising digital commerce in India Sparking cross-border trade via
open marketplaces
Just as the open network could make small
businesses discoverable by online buyers in
India, it could extend their reach to buyers
beyond borders as well. For example, a
wooden toy manufacturer in a village may
not need to invest in customer acquisition—
the simple step of joining the network could
give the company visibility to international
buyers and grow its customer base.

This could be especially beneficial for
MSMEs that lack the resources to invest
in discoverability and navigate the
complexities of cross-border trade. The
unbundling of the value chain could give
MSMEs access to specialised services.
For example, they could enjoy improved
price discovery for transport and logistics,
unlocking more efficient exports and
imports.

Growing digital commerce across
markets
The ONDC model could transform digital
commerce around the world—not just in
developing countries, but also in developed
nations, albeit in different ways (Exhibit 65).

For developing countries,76 ONDC could
take digital commerce to untapped
markets and enable small sellers to scale
their business digitally, yielding economic
benefits. Digital commerce penetration
in the Philippines, for example, is at only
21 percent, with 10 percent of MSMEs using
advanced digital tools. In Egypt, 29 percent
of MSMEs have no digital presence, and only
1 percent of MSMEs sell via online channels.
In addition to accelerating the adoption of
digital commerce and supporting the growth
and financial well-being of small businesses,
ONDC could over time transform the
emerging industry structure by embedding
digital commerce as an established model.

For developed countries, digital penetration
has been uneven across sectors. Even in
the United States, sectors such as grocery
and pharmaceuticals have digital commerce
adoption rates of only 11 to 12 percent.
ONDC could help increase demand by giving
consumers access to a broader assortment
of goods at a wide range of prices from a
larger number of online sellers, all through
an easy-to-use interface. The same dynamic
could play out in other sectors such as
pharma and B2B.

Democratising digital commerce in India Exporting a digital payments platform
India’s unified payments interface (UPI) has been widely successful worldwide, and ONDC could follow a similar
global trajectory. Like UPI, ONDC is an open network, so any country could use these protocols to build its own
open network for digital commerce. Many of the elements that contributed to UPI’s success in India also made it
applicable in other countries (Exhibit 66).

While ONDC could change the game in transforming digital commerce around the world,
four key enablers should ideally be in place to unlock its full value:

01

Support seamless cross-border
payment settlement and
information flows

Any scenario of cross-border payment will require
very clear information on country-level regulations
and rules for settlement.

02

Create robust grievance
redressal frameworks

Consumer protection laws vary across jurisdictions,
and protections in one country may not align with
those of the country where the business is
registered. A robust redressal framework could
ensure fast, satisfactory resolution of grievances,
inspiring trust among global users.

03
Build a globalised taxonomy

Buyers anywhere in the world seeking a specific
product (for example, a consumer in Thailand who
wants a Kanjivaram saree) should be able to find it
easily online. In addition, a taxonomy could ensure
buyer and seller apps know about country-specific
guidelines for the sale of products. For example, the
United States prohibits the import of many wildlife-
based products.1 Designing and implementing a
standardised taxonomy across countries could help
ensure a seamless experience for consumers.

04
Develop global co-operation
for digital commerce

ONDC could partner with international buyers and
seller apps to build an ecosystem that would give
consumers access to local digital commerce
experiences.

India offers a testing ground for the ability of an
open network to support digital commerce. The
success of ONDC could lead the network and India
to become global pioneers in connecting buyers
and sellers beyond borders. The world is watching
how this story plays out.

Getting on board
with ONDC

NDC holds the potential to create
open, inclusive, and competitive
marketplaces in the virtual world.
It will be important for companies

O

to carefully evaluate the options available
to them as they consider entering this
space. This could help them to identify plays
that maximise benefits from the immense
opportunities unlocked by the open network.

As company leaders look to make the most
of the opportunities ONDC offers, they could
explore the possibilities across two themes.

First, they could determine which use cases
have potential to scale fast and which would
take longer to yield results. And second,
they could evaluate where they are best
positioned to play—through the lens of the
market opportunity, their own capabilities,
and the consequent feasibility of investing in
specific use cases. This could support them
in making the most relevant investments
to achieve their company’s strategic
objectives.

141

Democratising digital commerce in India As companies think about use cases they
could prioritise, it would make sense to look
at their options through three lenses:

1.   The use case should solve an unsolved

problem.

2.   It should have a ready ecosystem (for
example, digitalised supply chain,
standardised goods and services, or ease
of logistics and fulfilment).

3.  It should be economically viable.

Assessing scalability
As a market maker keen to create
and democratise opportunities for all
participants, ONDC could catalyse a range
of business opportunities in the short,
medium and long term (Exhibit 67).

This answer emerged after analysing three
indicators of potential to scale:

 — Short term: Digitisation of existing
hyperlocal goods and services

 —  Medium term: Scaling up and innovating

in D2C businesses

 —  Long term: Digitising new use cases for
ONDC-first business models, especially
in B2B

Use cases in the short term could prove the most beneficial for driving early
adoption and scale.

Democratising digital commerce in India

Identifying the best-fit use case for
a company
Companies looking to develop innovative
business models that tap the open network
can examine the opportunity against
two considerations: how to participate
immediately in a fast-developing space, and
how to reimagine their business for an open
network and its possibilities.

Businesses need to zero in on the most
relevant use cases that map to their chosen
stance as a shaper or a fast follower.
They can accordingly identify a pool of
investable resources to help them pursue
the opportunity.

If the collective investments of companies
across industries can support the expansion
of ONDC, they could unlock the full
potential of digital commerce for buyers,
sellers, third-party providers, and India as
a whole. Companies and entrepreneurs
must carefully consider several strategic
questions:

 —  Evaluate the opportunity. How will an
open network disrupt the sector? What
is the problem that it will solve, and for
whom? Which are the most relevant use
cases for the business? What are the

potential benefits of addressing this
problem? What are the potential risks and
challenges in implementing these use
cases?

 — Identify the capability required.

Which role (e.g., seller, buyer, tech
service provider, etc.) is the company
best positioned to play? What are the
key capabilities needed to execute
the use case? What are the resource
requirements (for instance, people,
time, or money) in building out these
use cases? How should governance
be managed, including engagement
with the ONDC core team and network
participants?

 — Evaluate feasibility of the use cases.
When should a company decide to
implement or pilot a use case? Should
the organisation be a leader or a fast
follower? What are the feasibility
considerations for executing the use case
(for example, market, financial, or legal)?
What should be the pilot structure for
prioritised use cases including the initial
investment and scale-up milestones?

ONDC presents a unique avenue for India to
revolutionise its digital commerce landscape
and set an example for the world, much as it
did with UPI. With vast potential for a robust
buyer and seller ecosystem, ONDC represents
an opportunity that arises once in a decade.
Stakeholders—government, industry players, and
consumers—can determine how to seize this ‘tech-
ade,’ putting their best, most innovative selves
forward to democratise digital commerce for all.
